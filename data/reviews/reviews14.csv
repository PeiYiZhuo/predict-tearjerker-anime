    Robotics;Notes is probably the most ""realistic"" mecha out there, not really an expert in the genre, but hell, this is barely mecha, and  it was great. 
 
The first half was really good too, the characters were well done and Aki's relationship with Kaito was pretty cool, barely enough hints for you to understand that they are in love with each other but haven't confessed. 
Kona is by far the best character, she is hilarious and she makes so many references, it's fantastic, also seeing her develop her crush on Kaito was pretty enjoyable. 
 
BUT, the last episodes just went downhill, to the point where Kaito's confession became the best part of the last 4 episodes. Aki tries to confess but doesn't do it because it commonly sets a tragic death flag in mecha animes, an original response to a confession without a doubt, but they kiss nonetheless which confirms their feelings. UNFORTUNATELY, it feels as if the series had too many things going on at the same time, that the only way to put it together was with a deus ex. The ending episodes are pretty bad. 
 
The art was pretty cool, sometimes it wasn't the greatest but it was great nonetheless. 
 
The story was great until the end, where there were so many plot holes and questions unanswered it was almost rage inducing. 
 
The enjoyment for the first 15 episodes (more or less) was just excellent, 9/10. The last few... were a 7/10 because of the amount of ""coincidences""/cliches. 
 
Overall, the anime was really great because of the ""realistic"" side of a mecha anime, but there are so many  bad points to the story that it really outweighs the good points

    Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio are the only members of the Robotics Research Club of a high school. Unfortunately, this club is about to close because there are no more members. Akiho is working in the project of a giant robot her sister started before going to college while Kaito plays video games of giant robots all day. However, Kaito discovers a mysterious file, in his investigation he’ll discover the dark intentions behind it. 
 
Robotics;Notes it’s one of the best anime I’ve ever seen, from the first episode you’ll love Akiho and her open personality and her determination to save the club and finish the project of the giant robot. It might take some time to understand Kaito because he’s more conservative, but you’ll end thinking good things from him. We also have the eccentrically Kona Furugoori who lives in an abandoned building with her computer, but who will help in the quest to resolve the mystery of the strange file found by Kaito. 
 
The design of this anime it’s really good, you can’t tell the characters look like characters of another show, there’s a lot of friendship and the plot is not so affected to understand like it usually happens in many animes. 
 
What I would have really like is having a second season of this anime, or at least, the spin-off of one of the characters. I recommend to all those who hasn’t seen it yet to do it because this anime is all fun and will absorb you until the last episode.

    Robotics;Notes : A sci fi anime but not try to make it close to reality 
 
Okay, I have watched Steins;Gate before, and I will compare this anime according to my experienced with Steins;Gate. 
 
Robotics;Notes, the story is kind of normal and mainstream on the first few episodes. It's about a group of high school friends doing their club activities. The story got interesting when the main male character encounter an event and he got his own adventure. Soon after the story become complicated with a lot of mystery. In that universe that was a legendary mecha anime which the main female character really like. At first I thought that this show will somehow related to the main storyline, but it's actually not in a way that I hoped. After various events and encounter they solve the problem and it's ended in a good way. Like Steins;Gate who bring the SERN, LHC, and Time Traveling theory, Robotics;Noes also has something similar to that. They are JAXA, EXOSKELETON, NASA, and The Solar Flare. The story is interesting, but some part just didn't connected. The story will just score 8. 
 
The other part of the story was great. The character also great. Both the main male and female character are not randomly change. They keep that character personality just like that till the end. 
 
This story is VERY GOOD. You will enjoy it, try to watch it. If you like Steins;Gate, you probably would like this show. Both are scientific but somehow they try to keep it as close as reality.  
 
I write this review based on my personal opinion. Of course anybody can agree or disagree. But, if you're disagree, just post comment on my profile or message me. I will gladly discuss it with you. 
 
Please enjoy the show and thanks for reading my review. 
Hope it helps. 
 
WineZ...

    Set in the Steins;Gate universe can be appreciated by any mecha fan, and even more so by a Gurren Lagann/Gundam Fans or by the robotic computer creation clubs in high school. Gun Barrel can be equated to the favored mecha show had the show cause havoc.  
The ever so ambitious Aki attempts to succeed her sister in the creation of a life size replica of Gun Barrel. With her club members builds the dream of building the hope that stands that's Gun Barrel that Aki’s sister abandoned after graduating high school to work at a high tech company. 
 
Utilizing those slice of life moments with wireless PED’s [snapchat filters(AR’s)/GPS caching/ and of course high school] to enclose our hearts closer to a childish dream, that became grander than it seemed.  
 
Aki a strong female lead smart, willful, of and persevering keeps the show driving, while Kai laid back always reclining, is the pilot to the robotics club. And eventually the club builds up to the Programmer, the Club Mascot, etc.  
 
 
Junjou Spectra sets the thrill we all want in an anime and typically crucial to a mecha anime. 
While “Topology” provides that nostalgic feel at the end of every episode that gives the urge of wanting more.

    I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOOOOVE IT, are the words I would begin to describe this show. There is something compelling about a self-aware Gundam show that takes its self seriously with its characters, plot, action, and comedy. Before I get into the explanation part I’ll have to recommend the dub if you plan to watch this. This has by far one of the best dubs I’ve seen, it’s got great localization for North America and the actors fit perfectly. It’s a see to believe it kind of deal. It really helped improve the show for me and if given a chance might be a great experience for you as well.  
 
Spoilers as usual  
 
Story: Initially I had some doubts about the story, it starts out by talking about saving the world and then jumps into a comedy style club group? This may already seem to be the perfect setup for a generic “high school kids get superpowers and save the world” kinda scenario but in reality its far from it. The story doesn’t have either of those but rather both at the same time. At first it does stick with the main focus of the club and the comedy routine until some events aspire and adds a whole new parallel plot alongside the current one. Of course, the one moving back and forth between these two is the main character Yoshino, but I’ll get into the effect of this on him later. These dual concurrent plots are something that’s really rare in media of any form, the only other media I can think of with this is assassins creed. Having two main characters developing(Desmond and eizo) was not an easy thing to pull off and it worked wonderfully for the game. Robotic notes takes this with stride as the show has two casts one being Subaru, Koujiro, Daitoku, and Akiho, while Airi, Ko Kimijima, and Matija being there own cast. Dual plots if done right can be extremely strong, in this case, was a big pay off. If it was just about a club building a big robot then it would be boring, if it was about discovering the mysteries of some scientist it would be boring. But when working in tangent with each other, it goes from humor to mystery, thriller to romance, drama, and action. Juxtaposing constantly with each other to make some interesting elements of developments and character growth. 
 
 
 
Characters: The beauty of subtlety and how it fits into these characters so well. Yashio was by far the most well written and changes so quiet it was astounding when you finally notice it. When the show first started you see a shallow and rather unexciting main character. By the end of it you see an entirely different person, one with conviction, purpose, and maturity. The biggest reason for this change was his involvement in both concurrent plots and trying to piece together who exactly Ko Kimijima really is. I really enjoy this sort of tone shift that happens periodically. The lighting, shots and music change dramatically here and completely gave the show a new perspective. It made Yoshio’s character experience all kinds of dramatic events and scenes which made his character at the end of the show truly fell like it had changed rather than written that way. I also found the changes to be very effective in keeping me engaged and sensitive to these shifts since they were not used a lot in the show. The first main supporting cast Subaru, Koujiro, Daitoku, were all nice characters with each having their own individual character episodes. Akiho as a character was much better in the latter half than first. This makes sense from the story standpoint since her major conflicts don’t show up until then. But for someone as important as her, she lacked screentime for a big chunk. I found the romance to be sweet but lacked proper development. The other half of the cast was a mixed bag, Airi I had major problems with. The virtual character part of her was fine but since she forgot everything that happened to her when she woke up it made the character progression nullified. This effectively destroyed her character and ruins so much time that was spent on her throughout the story. She was also pretty damn cute. Ko Kimijima was an alright villain, he lacked a creative character but the twist from good to evil was the only benefit of his character. Him becoming digital and losing his emotion was a step in the wrong direction and they should have made him keep his emotions instead for a better villain and character. Mashija was cool I don’t have much to say about her.  
 
 
 
Visuals: l wasn’t impressed, to say the least. It’s a bit aged now but still has a fluid movement which was rare for back then. Production IG has always been a silent studio in popularity compared to its counterparts like madhouse, bones and A1. There were some really interesting uses of cinematography and lighting, which I would love to see more of in anime cause these subtle difference can have a huge impact.  
 
 
 
Soundtrack: Lots of hype and slice of life music. The OP and ED were decent and didn’t stand out that much. The first OP Junjou Spectra by Zwei was kickass and made me hyped for the show but the second didn’t deliver that well compared to the first. All and all a basic tracklist for comedy, action, and mystery. Nothing bad but nothing fantastic either. 
 
 
 
Dub: ok now for the dub. The saving grace for this show, and what I believe made me like this show so much. Ironically after researching, I was scratching my head confused about why it was so good. None of the voice actors (with exception Leah Clark and Clifford Chapin) were that popular or important. They still did a banged up job with the acting though, and I’m probably going to contribute this to those who did the auditions. Funimation doesn’t just have good actors but also great actor selecting as well. For me, I found the actors perfectly aligned with their character's personality and it made the experience so much more enjoyable with how authentic they felt.  
 
 
 
Overall: I can’t contest for the VN source material and what it’s like but I enjoyed this anime a lot. I still feel like I’m overreacting as what I’ve seen and read online, it isn’t as good as I make it out to be. None the less I hope you give it a try and find the same level of enjoyment I that felt with this show.

    This anime was pretty good overall. I enjoyed it most of the way through. But through the first half I had NO IDEA what kind of show it was trying to be. At first I thought it was a generic club anime where ppl are trying to get members to keep their club going. Then it turned into a mecha fight tournament show, then it got all creepy and turned into a thriller kind of show. But near the end it really surprised me (Mild spoiler)  when the the main girl Aki-chan was like ""After you get back from you mission I have something important to tell you"". And I was like ""Oh god shes gonna confess her love to him and its the MC is gonna be all dense and not know whats going on cuz all MC's r fckin morons who don't know whats going on"". But in reality Hes pretty smart and confessed to her instead and they actually kiss and stuff. Which surprised the poop out of me. Cause this is the first anime I've  ever seen where the MC actually hooks up with the childhood friend EVER. Anyways. That right there makes this anime unique and worth watching imo.

    In this ""Episode"" you will be watching a small portion of the schools training, (mainly focused on Sohoku) a little while before Inter High at Hakone occur. Should you waste time to watch this? Well why not, you get to know a bit more about Onoda's anime merchandise and relationship with his ""Climber Senpai""! 
Also if you still did not watch the anime, this episode might be a bit spoiler so check the first 20 episodes, before you come watch this! 
 
Good points of this special episode is that you get to see a little morel development between a Senpai and Kohai's Friendship, I'm referring to Makishima and Onoda the Team Climbers of course! Is something that got me curious about, since both characters are way to different one from another and they must tag along for almost half a day. 
 
For a moment I  though, maybe I should not waste time watching this, but half way I though opposite, glad I did. 
 
Regardless my score give to this episode, I must say, I did not get hooked up for another anime so much has this one in the past couple of months. If you don't know if its worthy or not, just give it a try! And if I may add, I'm not much of a Anime Sport's Fan myself and nor I like to watch ""ongoing"" anime.

    [This review applies to both YowaPeda recap movies] 
 
Since the third season of Yowamushi Pedal is airing right now, I had decided to refresh my memory about the two last seasons and hence I watched both recap movies, Re:RIDE and Re:ROAD. 
 
Unfortunately, many recap movies fail at summing up the story without excluding key scenes, making them feel incomplete. But unlike these movies Re:RIDE/Re:ROAD managed to keep the original feeling of the Inter Highs in only three hours, even if the source material is much, much longer. From the iconic Onoda and Tadokoro singing scene to Izumida's glorious ""Andy! Frank!"", it literally has everything. Even some bits of the (many) background stories are shown.  
 
Besides, the writers also included movie exclusive scenes involving Makishima, Onoda and Toudou in Re:RIDE and the Senpai Line of Hakone in Re:ROAD. These extra scenes reveal a little more about their relationships too. If you're a fan you will love them! 
 
Overall, both, Re:RIDE and Re:ROAD, are decent recap movies involving the highlights of the story, as well as something new to spice it up. I think it's worth watching these recaps if you (like me) watched the anime two years ago. If your memory is still good I'd suggest to skip the recap part and just watch the movie original scenes.

    The world of Pokemon can be a strange, wonderful, and often terrifying place.  Along with humans and a select few diminutive and unimpressive animals, this world is inhabited by a race of peculiar creatures known as, of course, Pokemon.  These creatures come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny moles and worms to giant whales and rock-snakes, and while some of the smaller ones might make good pets, almost all of them are capable of devastating feats.  It’s understandable that some people may give Pokemon a wide berth, avoiding them at all costs, but there are a few brave souls among us who dare to encounter them up close and personal on a regular basis, bettering themselves in order to overcome any obstacle the world’s Pokemon might put forth.  We call them Pokemon Trainers, and the very best among them, who’ve captured or at least owned one sample out of every known Pokemon, are considered Pokemon Masters!  Of course, realistically, there can only be one Pokemon Master, as a select few Pokemon are one-of-a-kind, and capturing just one of them destroys the chances for anyone else to achieve said accolade.  Seriously, what’s up with that? 
 
Among these unique creatures are the legendary birds, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.  These Titans of unimaginable elemental power live on a series of islands near Shamouti in the Orange Islands region, engaged in an ancient stalemate over their territory, unknowingly guarding the dormant beast of the sea.  Should any one of those three be captured and removed from the scenario, that beast will roar to life and throw the world into chaos.  This legend has attracted the attention of Lawrence III, a Pokemon collector with a hunger for the rare and valuable.  Using his incredible technology, he has every intention of capturing these titans in order to lure out the beast of the sea...  Who he believes to be the legendary Lugia.  Unfortunately for him, an old prophecy states that when the balance of power taming the beast becomes perturbed, a chosen one can step in and make things right again!  And as it just so happens, Ash Ketchum and his friends are passing through the area on the way to their next Orange Islands gym battle, when they wind up getting dragged into the conflict.  When the world turns to ash, will one of these brave souls step up and take the world’s fate into their own hands?  Or will humanity become the next one-of-a-kind species? 
 
Remember in my review of the first movie, how I said it struck the right balance between CG and 2D animation, and that the balance would get progressively worse with each passing movie?  This is where it starts, and oh boy does it get off to a noticeable start.  Right off the bat, we’re shown Lawrence’s Castle in the Sky, a giant floating base somehow kept in the air by slowly turning propellers.  If this movie had come out a few years later, it would probably be paired with Feel Good Inc as it’s pop song BGM.  Anyway, this thing is the most obvious, out of place computer-generated construct since the tongue beasts in the first Resident Evil movie, and two dimensional characters appearing in the same shot look about as real and natural as paper dolls taped to a very expensive child’s toy.  It’s also pretty obvious how much money went into this thing, because about half of this movie’s animation is about as low quality as the show, with talking heads moving and freezing on still canvases, and barely any background movement in shots that have lots of people on them. 
 
If that’s not bad enough, there’s a scene very early on where the team is travelling by boat, and they’re hit by a storm that causes some turbulence.  There is a shot where Pikachu is standing nervously on the rocking boat in a close-up, and I swear to Arceus they just took the still image and shook it around to give the illusion of movement.  Characters often seem to freeze into the background whenever they’re not talking, some of the scenes are very poorly shot(like Ash’s arrival on Shamouti), and a lot of the movie is distinctly out of frame, due to 4Kids’ decision to convert the film from widescreen to fullscreen.  Another obvious CG effect is an entirely pointless scene where hoards of Pokemon are stuck on an ice sheet staring out into the water, but can still be seen moving from a mile away, including Kangaskhan doing her little sumo stomp.  The only moments where the CG and 2D elements blend nicely to the tune of a decent budget, and thus the moments that differentiate it from future movies, are the action scenes, most notably when the legendary birds are fighting either Lawrence’s devices, each other, or both.  The animation for these moments are breathtaking, fast paced, and over-all a joy to watch, to the point that I’d actually say it’s worth sitting through the rest of the movie’s animation to get there.   
 
The music, however, is a step up from the first movie.  The score is powerful and epic, particularly with the music that accompanies the action set pieces.  Rather than a Danny Elfman sound, like the first movie utilized, this one has more of a John Williams sound, which is equally appropriate.  Where the first film had a dark and ominous tone, this one plays out more like a grand, sweeping adventure, so the music has to be a lot bolder and, well, for lack of a better term, bigger.  This does unfortunately result in a lot of the tunes sounding a bit homogenized, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as this type of movie kind of calls for it.  It only tends to get annoying when it comes to what I can only describe as the musical motif of the film, a certain wind tune that a new female character introduces us to.  She never states what she’s playing, and I can’t identify it by ear, so we’ll just call it an Ocarina.  It’s important to the plot, so I can’t harp on it too much, but suffice to say it gets old pretty quick.  Thankfully, with Lugia’s Song as an example, it rarely ever plays in the background without evolving into something far more awesome. 
 
The soundtrack in this movie is nowhere near as embarrassing as the first one, as it seems to have been put together with a much better focus than it’s pop-song grabbing predecessor.  The Ocarina motif that I mentioned before gets expanded into a full song by Donna Summer, which was based off of one of this movie’s three names, The Power of One.  It’s a pretty great song, not gonna lie, but it’s very nature carries one of the most unfortunate problems with the english version of the movie, which I’ll get to later.  The pop version of Pokemon World is also pretty awesome, even though it’s being sung by two nineties bands that haven’t been mentioned by living people for over ten years.  Yeah, the song itself is fun, but it only really becomes cringeworthy if you watch the two bands performing it onstage, which is totally a thing on the DVD extras.  Those poor teen bastards.  Even the actors from Pokemon Live came away more dignity than that.  Flying Without Wings by Westlife is a pretty decent song...  well, at least the cut the movie used...  And for a bit of unexpected weirdness, Weird Al actually pops up in the credits to combine the Pokerap with his own Polka trend.   
 
It’s not what I’d call a perfect soundtrack, but at least they tried to keep things relevant this time around.  But much like the first movie, there are tunes on the CD that didn’t make it into the movie...  Dreams by Alysha Antonino has the makings of a pretty good song, but the production features the absolute worst flavor of the late nineties.  The lyrics themselves are almost poignant in their message, but the orchestration is just butt ugly.  The Extra Mile by Laura Pausini is really generic, and could easily be placed in the credits of almost any film without feeling out of place.  I hate to get mean over a song that’s been lost in time, but when I buy a CD and load the songs to Itunes, this is the kind of song I leave off.  The same could be said by One Heart by O-Town, which probably the most memorable forgotten band in existence, and With All Your Heart by Plus One.  The only songs present that are as entertainingly bad as the last CD are Chosen One by The B-52s, which almost seems to be making fun of the movie’s prophecy, and They Just Don’t Understand, a song by a bunch of twelve year olds called Dream Street about their love of the franchise.  This one also appears on the DVD in all it’s cringy glory, you’re welcome. 
 
For the most part, there isn’t much I can say about the english dub without talking about the series, as the acting in this movie is pretty much the same as the series at it’s best.  I’ve always felt that the acting was the best part of the 4Kids dub, with the writing always being more hit-or-miss, heavy emphasis on the miss.  I will concede that Ed Paul as Tracey is slightly less annoying than Eric Stuart as Brock.  That, and while it might just be my imagination, Addie Blaustein was putting forth a bit more effort than usual as Meowth.  Another performance of note comes from Veronica Taylor, who we’ve all gotten used to hearing as Ash, but also gets to play Ash’s mother in this film, and she gets a really heartfelt exchange with him later in the movie.  Eric Rath was a bit on the forgettable side in his turn as Lugia, and despite having just as little voice acting experience, Neil Stewart was quite a bit better as Lawrence.  Nathan Price, who’s done a bit more than those two, does a great job as Slowking, making the character sound like a slow, dim-witted person who’s somehow come upon great intelligence but still speaks like he used to. 
 
The worst thing about this dub are the changes it made to the material, of which there are far too many.  There was at least one plot point that I hoped was a rewrite, but no, it wasn’t...  The rewrites that do exist are way worse.  The relationship between the Legendary Birds and the Beast of the Sea is given a much better explanation in the Japanese, although it’s still a work of fantasy, so it’s not THAT much better.  There was originally a moment when Tracey was allowed to shine by helping his friends to science their way out of a jam, but that got cut, so he’s basically as useless as his Venonat was in the opening short.  Much worse than these, and probably much more shocking to westerners who’ve never seen both versions, is the fact that the whole “Power of One” idea was entirely a dub-only concept.  In the Japanese, not only was there no such thing as a ‘chosen one,’ but from what I’ve been told, there was no prophecy, either.  The film actually had a heavy emphasis on teamwork, which makes more sense considering how much help Ash needs throughout.  Much like the pacifism of the first movie, this just goes to show how confused 4Kids can get when it comes to teaching western-friendly morals.  If you can, stick to the sub. 
 
If you knew me around the turn of the century, you’d know that I was a huge Pokemon fanatic.  If you were also a member of the Pokemon fandom, you probably also knew that I was a huge fan of the Orange Islands arc.  To this day, it’s still my favorite season of the original series, and the only season that I own on DVD.  It was just so different from anything that came before, or that’s come out of the series since.  As far as I’m aware, it was the only season to not be connected to the games, although I did at least attempt to run the fan-made Pokemon Orange-version on my piece of crap MacIntosh.  I loved how much creative freedom it had, as it wasn’t tied down to the formula of the Kanto region, as they didn’t have to dedicate each episode to revealing a new Pokemon, and they could just write episodes revolving around new concepts of older, already established Pokemon.  Some very popular iconic Pokemon got to take center stage, like Lapras and Snorlax, and the battles didn’t have to be actual battles, and there was a lot more material for Pokeshippers.  It was a breath of fresh air, and the news of an upcoming movie finally got my ass into theaters. 
 
So how did it hold up?  Well, you hardly need me to tell you how popular it is.  While the critics were notoriously tough on it, giving it only a one point advantage over it’s predecessor, it is one of the most common fan favorites among the actual Pokemon fandom.  It’s lowest review score on Myanimelist is a 6(until now), and none of those reviews lasted more than a single page(until now).  It’s not hard to see why, because this was the first Pokemon movie to feel like an actual movie.  It had a more epic, theatrical feel to it, with higher stakes and arguably a more ambitious story than most other Pokemon films.  It introduced two Generation 2 Pokemon, not counting Elekid in the opening short, and the ones it did introduce in the main story were actually important to the plot, not cannon fodder in a random opening battle.  It’s not often considered the best movie in the Pokemon line-up, that honor often goes to the Entei and Lucario movies, but it is a generally respected and highly regarded movie...  Which is why it might surprise you to hear me say that it really isn’t THAT much better than the first film. 
 
Now, credit where credit is due, it does a much better job following the traditional three act structure.  In the first act, we meet the villain.  We learn about who he is, what his plan is, and what will happen if said plan comes to fruition.  We also get introduced to the main character, why he’s in the area, and how he gets drawn into the conflict.  We get all the backstory we need, and then some, as well as intros of basically every single plot point that’s going to matter.  In the second act, the plot picks up, and we see the main character set out to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible, even though the conflict is way bigger and more dangerous than he initially thought, and his inability to solve the problem leads him into a worsening situation, where things basically hit rock bottom.  Finally, in the third act, the worst case scenario happens, the main makes a much grander stand, and it all builds to a climax that delivers on everything that set it up.  Power of One follows the three act structure so well that it’s almost like the writers made a conscious effort to do so, and it’s ultimately the reason that the movie feels so much more like, well, a movie. 
 
Having said that, a three act structure doesn’t guarantee the movie will be good, and for all of it’s grandeur and epic nature, this movie has just as much stupid, lore and continuity breaking material in it as the last one.  First of all, harping on the English dub, the prophecy is completely pointless.  Not only does it feel mind-numbingly stupid that some ancient prophecy knows who Ash is and decides that only he, one of the most incompetent heroes in anime history, can possibly set the world back to right, but there was nothing in the prophecy about Lawrence starting all of this conflict.  It also doesn’t work in terms of the story, because Ash doesn’t need a prophecy to tell him to go into action and save the world...  He’s a good person, he’ll do it anyway!  Hell, I wouldn’t even make that point if it wasn’t for the fact that (mild spoilers in this sentence) Team Rocket, the show’s signature antagonists, decide all on their own to turn over a new leaf and act heroic for the sake of saving the planet.  Ash needed a prophecy to call him out by name(In an oh so clever pun that fooled absolutely nobody), but Team Rocket are the altruists in the scenario?  Bull to the motherfucking shit! 
 
Going right back to act one, not only does Lawrence have a Pokemon trading card...  Which just throws all kinds of logic out the window, because this isn’t Digimon Tamers we’re watching...  But the exposition he gets from his computer makes no sense.  It identifies the prophecized Titans as the legendary birds, which means he likely didn’t know that yet, and since the prophecy mentioned nothing about Shamouti, how the hell is he already in the area?  And why are Ash and friends taking a ferry, when they usually just ride on Lapras’s back?  It would make sense in a Pokemon game, but they never had random encounters on her back before.  Also, how did Lawrence and Ash move into position on the exact annual day that the island was expecting this exact catastrophe to occur?  Then in the second act, we get such gems as Tracey being useless, a flying sailboat, Ash trying to tackle an electrified cage, and to top it all off, there’s a strong implication that in order to catch all existing Pokemon...  Or to “Catch’em All,” which is explicitly the catch phrase of the series, you would have to destroy the world as we know it in the process.  I don’t think they really thought this through. 
 
Then the third act happens, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it damn near justifies everything.  In the first movie, the “third act,” if you could call it that, is where it failed hardest, as it used it’s climax to crawl right up inside it’s own ass.  This, however, is what a third act is supposed to be.  Every single plot point, even the worst ones like Misty bantering with Melody over her crush on Ash, comes to a satisfying conclusion.  Even though there’s well-animated action scenes throughout the movie, this part of the story upstages all of them, as it should, with Lawrence being largely written out of the story so the birds themselves can fight among themselves, and it’s as awesome as it sounds.  That’s not to say nothing stupid happens...  Bulbasaur and Squirtle are shown to run as fast as Charizard flies, in a scenario when he really should have tried to call out Lapras, and the dialogue between Melody and Misty ends in an exchange that doesn’t make much sense...  I’m assuming only one person in that group has any idea how to play the Ocarina...  But it doesn’t matter, because every moment leads to something great.  Does that make all the stupid crap that we had to sit through to get to that point okay?  No, not really, but at least there’s something at the end worth sitting through it all for.  It’s not much, but it’s something. 
 
Pokemon the movie 2000, also known as The Power of One and Revelation Lugia, is available from Viz Media in both single format and a three-pack with the first and third films. .  You can also find the out of print original DVD from Warner Home Video, albeit at a much more expensive price.  Unlike the first movie, you can also find the soundtrack and score on the same CD, although brand new copies are quite a bit more expensive.  Netflix generally has about four or five different Pokemon movies available for legal streaming at any given time, and this is occasionally one of them. 
 
Despite my criticisms, this is my favorite Pokemon movie, and it’s the one I have the most nostalgic feelings for.  There are at least two scenes in it that make me cry...  One involving Team Rocket, the other involving Ash’s mom...  And that’s something no other Pokemon movie can say.  It also expands upon the lore in a lot of interesting ways, such as giving a few characters first names for the first time.  Of course, just because it’s my personal favorite doesn’t make it one of the best ones.  I wouldn’t even call it one of the top five.  Looked at as a sequel, it just barely surpasses the first movie in terms of scale and execution, but the story is still based on coincidence, there’s still a lot of dumb and inaccurate material, and it breaks the fourth wall more than any Pokemon movie should.  It doesn’t fall into the trap of pushing a confused and hypocritical moral, but it only pulls this off by not trying to push ANY moral...  Which is probably the smart way to go, but it still doesn’t convey the kind of growth that a sequel should go through.  It’s sense of pacing, structure and emotional resonance, as well as it’s killer third act ultimately saves it from receiving a score as low as the first film, but it still doesn’t earn it a good score, as much as I may love it.  I give Pokemon the Movie 2000 a 5/10.

    I remember it being tugging on my heartstrings even as a child when we saw the three legendary birds - especially Articuno for me which has been my favorite since this came out.  
 
I watched this for the first time as a child at the age of 6 in the Cinema. It's a memory that never fades; it was beautiful, empowering, funny, and emotional all in one. I remember crying towards the end of the movie; it was a very powerful moment.  
 
*I don't want to spoil anything for someone who hasn't had the pleasure to see this movie yet so I won't go into detail* 
 
I guess the weak link in the chain is the villain of the movie for the 1/3 of the movie. It could have done a better job with him, or completely remove his arc and flesh out the characters we already know / got to know in this movie.  
 
 
Just watch it for the first time. Re-watch it. 
 
Pokemon isn't just for children, which is a huge misconception. There's a lot to take away from a adult perspective.  
You'll love it. 
 
 
 
Definitely worth re-watching as an adult just for  the nostalgia. The orchestra that accompanied the movie is superb - A masterpiece in itself.  
 
I can't believe that a Pokemon movie had its own ORCHESTRA. it's amazing. I still have the OST and Lugia's song is emotional even after so many years.  
The animation is a beautiful old-school.  
 
When Lugia Theme played for the first time I remember how the tears streamed down my cheeks. I had never heard anything so beautiful before in my life. Even today I can hear how amazing it is, but today it only brings me joy.  
 
The joy of having been able to experience this magical adventure a child and adult both.

    A step down from the first movie, but still really good.  
 
Getting it out of the way first, the flaws that made it weaker than the first one. Lawrence III was nowhere near as much of a compelling villain as Mewtwo, being much more of a generic ""i'm gonna steal these Pokemon"" guy. The action scenes and climax were also not as intense as the first one, though still very enjoyable, and the direction/production wasn't quite as good as the amazing direction of the first one. 
 
With that out of the way, it was great, and in some ways even better than the first. The story with the gang trying to stop the legendary birds from destroying the world, and the whole prophecy of Ash being the chosen one, was all really thrilling and cool, and possibly even better than the first (not as thin). As mentioned, the action scenes and direction may have been weaker than the first one, but they were still great, and the animation was lovely. And finally, it had lots of nice comedy. (""We're slowing Lugia down, we're too heavy!"" 
""Let's try Weightwatchers"") 
 
So overall, still a great movie. Like the first, i'd recommend it to any fan.

    This is another nostalgia inducing movie. The good old days of Pokemon before it started going through extreme changes. It has many old favorites, many legendary Pokemon, and good villains. I cannot remember it in extreme detail, but, if you haven't watched this Pokemon movie yet, I highly recommend it. It is pure enjoyment and overall will likely just make you feel good. If you are highly critical or dislike childish things, maybe this isn't for you, but if you just like to sit back and relax at something without a horribly complex plot, this is really good for that. Thanks for reading.

    hands down this is my favorite pokemon movie ever. i know that again like most pokemon movies, they don't have a direct tie to the show but that's just fine with me. i liked the whole idea of this movie and it gave me the familiar feel that i got when watching the old pokemon show. i liked the original voice of the characters and the new ones along with the music that goes along with it, i have some of it on my ipod to prove that ^^ i really enjoyed this movie for the use of the legendary birds and the role lugia was able to place into it. lugia will always be the guardian to the seas in my eyes

    The second movie in the mighty franchise and once again throws the hero Ash into a deep story revolving around Legendary Pokemon.  
The story revolves around the 3 main characters of the second series of Pokemon - Ash, Misty and Tracey. The three heroes are joined by the energetic captain Maren and her sister Melody. 
The main storyline of this film is fufilling the prophacy which was laid down from generation to the next and stopping the great pokemon collector Lawrence III from stealing Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. 
 
The art was decently good as expected from the series and the soundtrack is very well made and is quite extensive.  
Unforutnatly as with the rest of the Pokemon Series, the characters are quite plain and two dimensional. Though this can be overcome by the wide variaty of characters in it. Even including another talking psychic pokemon which provides and humorous touch to the series along with the useless bumbling Team Rocket. 
 
The Movie itself is quite enjoyable and his overall is great but it can be held back by the lack of character personalility but other than this it is quite a good film to watch. Any Pokemaniacs will want to see this film

    After the first Pokémon movie, this is a bit of a disappointment. 
 
The art it still very beautiful and detailed, but here they added computer animation to the mix, and I personally hate that, especially when put in the middle of traditional anime; it looks ugly and out of place, no way around it. 
 
They didn't pay as much attention to detail in this one when it came to the plot, and it was a bit thinner than the first one. The beginning, which lay out the basis of the story, also seemed a little short/incomplete. It simply could have had... more in it. 
 
Of course this movie also lacked the emotional charge of the first one. A decent movie, better than some of the episodes, but when it's put into comparison with something better, it is easy to see they could have put more effort into storytelling and add a little more depth. 
 
Also, I've never really found the Pokémon's telepathic voices to fit them. I don't know why. They just seem odd, especially Lugia's in this one. 
 
Not a bad movie, though. Very watchable.

    The second Pokemon movie is a step down from the first one in almost every way. This doesn't have to be a condemnation in and of itself, but when your movie doesn't have enough new elements to replace watered down or missing older ones, then problems appear. 
 
The most obvious difference between the first and the second movie is the setting. First movie was set inside a bulbeous lovecraftian castle shrouded by a terrifying storm. There was no attempt at topping this, which is a good thing. Bigger doesn't equal better. It merely leads to excess. Unfortunately, the setting of the second movie is underwhelming. It revolves around a generic tropic archipelago. Still, while the location sounds unremarkable and it most certainly is, the movie does toy with viewer's expectations by using the plot to turn tropical paradise into a cold wasteland. 
 
When discussing Pokemon movies, symbolism, foreshadowing and subtle set ups and payoffs don't generally come to mind. Neither does scientific accuracy nor explanations of any kind. This is because latter movies utilize magic by default, ushering in the age of ""anything goes"". This isn't the norm early in the series, although the first glimpses of this trend are being set in this movie, which will be discussed further on. Still, all is not bad. As plot progresses and natural disasters strike, we get a wonderful scene of Professor Oak improvising an explaination of the shifting ocean currents to journalists, using a notebook and a pen. Scenes like this give the movie unique flavor and let us immerse ourselves in the world easier. They let us understrand the threat and which exact things are at stake. Due to moments like this we can believe Pokemon world is a tangible alternate reality instead of a bog standard fantasy rollercoaster experience. 
 
Unfortunately, we also get a flat villain with a magical castle that makes no sense and the movie is happy to just ignore it all. Used as a plot necessity (that's not neccesary, really), the flying castle is one of the low points of the movie. Fortunately, its design is nice to the eyes. Seeing the villain, Lawrence, quickly characterized as a member of wealthy nobility (grand European art and arhitecture included), really pulls these elements out of the gutter. 
 
The first movie featured some nice references for adults. For example, the clone production machine's shape was clearly inspired by the Fibonacci squence, signaling creation of life. I haven't noticed any such ideas in this movie, which is a shame.  
 
While there was some interesting subtext in character interaction, there was no payoff in the end. Any complexities characters could've had were ultimately played for laughs, while conclusions and follow ups were not bothered with. This, along with some points raised previously, grounds the movie firmly in the mindless action camp. 
 
With the movie not bothering to make characters and locations interesting, its plot would need a miracle to end up written well. And so it wasn't. Fortunately for the movie, action was good and the high stakes were communicated successfuly. The action scenes were where the budget went and it shows. Some credit should also be given to the atmosphere this work created. The strength of nature and wilderness were successfuly communicated, pushing the bland sections into enjoyable territory. 
 
Considering this movie's budget was the same as the previous, but the movie achieved much less in pretty much every area, it can be considered a disapointment. It was eclipsed by the vastly more complex and emotionally gripping predecessor and marked the point that cemented future Pokemon releases as less and less ambitious, never to recapture the epic qualities of the first. 
 
Still, was it a bad movie? I'll have to go with a firm no. While the complexities were done away with, the stakes, action and setting were different enough to stand out as their own adventure. Still, unless you're heavy on nostalgia, you won't remember this one in a few years.  
 
""The Power of One"" is watchable without many frustrations, but also devoid of ambition. Even if you're not a Pokemon fan you could have a mildly fun time with this one.

    I remember it was my 5th birthday and I was staying at a hotel. (17 now) but I had seen the commercials for this movie and played the pokemon monopoly game along with all the video games. When my mom handed me a gift that was wrapped in normal newspaper. I had received the first movie for my birthday along with the 2nd one for Christmas the next year. I was the happiest person than anyone in the world and I really loved looking at the cover art. But my favorites would definitely have to be this one and the third one.  
 
Even though they have started changing the way the movies look by adding 3d backgrounds and its getting kind of ridiculous with the number of movies they have come out with. You gotta admit the first couple of movies were the best. I had always supported this series since the day it came out and I know a lot of people hold this series deep in their hearts because they grew up with it and we will probably watch them with out kids. But I just have to say that I love pokemon forever and always.

    For those of you who weren't around in '00, or were too young to remember, Pokemon was still at an early point. Before there were a billion games including spin-offs and enough merchandise to bankrupt an entire nation. And we were all eagerly anticipating Silver & Gold in 2001. What's that? You got those games considerably earlier? Well, in the EU we got them in early 2001. In any case, we were all gathering every scrap of information we could and this film promised us a first look at Lugia, even though the games were already out elsewhere and we'd seen her image on the Internet. Regardless, a lot of people were excited to see this film in theatres. I wasn't allowed to because we were poor and theatre tickets for me and all three of my siblings were pricey. But I do remember what a big deal this was for a lot of people my age. I'm still not going easy on it.  
 
Story: 
 
We open with a collector, we'll call him Kivas Fajo, in his advanced aircraft base. He's after the legendary birds, Moltres, Articuno and Zapdos. He hopes to acquire them and draw out Lugia so he can capture it as well. Then he'll make them all wear their outfits, sit in their chairs and entertain his guests. Little does Kivas realise that capturing the birds will throw the planet out of balance causing upheavals and, possibly, the end of the world. It's naturally up to Satoshi and his companions to deal with the situation.  
 
Now, I'm not going to worry about spoilers too much since the Pokemon anime is kind of predictable and formulaic. Plus this film is around twenty years old if we're going by the original Japanese release. So, moving on to the first problem with the narrative. Kivas suffers from a serious case of ""dumb villain."" This dude accidentally brings Satoshi and his group aboard his airship, then he leaves them alone so they can easily interfere with his operation and foil his plans. Another problem is that the film has a lot of pointless moments. All the Pokemon converging on the islands for the confrontation and then doing fuck all, the scenes with Professor Ookido & Satoshi's mum, they just don't seem to contribute anything.  
 
You might argue that the Pokemon converging is to illustrate the importance of taking action even when things look bleak, but they actually do nothing so it doesn't really work.  
 
The best thing I can say for the narrative is that it has some pretty neat action moments. The whole fight sequence with the birds is pretty amazing. The Lugia reveal is also nicely done. The film shows a lot of bubbling underwater and uses a bunch of other tricks to obfuscate Lugia's appearance before finally bringing it out at the climax in a massive jet of water. It's a strong, well-paced reveal.  
 
Characters: 
 
The characters are kind of under-written and not very interesting. Satoshi does whine too much for my taste. One thing worth mentioning, however, is that Satoshi's companions are basically useless while Team Rocket acts heroically. Which is a weird decision. You wouldn't expect a children's work to give the spotlight to the petty villains.  
 
But it does. Kasumi & Kenji help pull Satoshi out of the water once and that's basically it. Aside from that they stand around picking particles out of their anuses. And Pikachu was already working on getting Satoshi to shore. So, if Pikachu had thought to grab Lapras' pokeball from Satoshi's bag, they would have been completely pointless. They don't even bring out their Pokemon to try to free Zapdos & Moltres from their cages. Musashi and Kojirou bring out Arbok and Weezing. They also go to Satoshi's rescue when he comes to an impasse and things look hopeless. Then they dodge attacks from legendary birds to get him to the artefact he needs to save the world. And they very nearly sacrifice themselves so the world can be saved.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork looks fine. Kivas' airship looks a bit out of place when compared to the rest of the art. There's also a fail with Doctor Uchikido's completely ambivalent facial expression while she talks about the potential end of the world. The action sequence with the birds is the highlight in terms of art. And seeing Lugia use Aeroblast is really cool. The whole sequence with Musashi and Kojirou taking an inflatable raft up through a bunch of caverns looks cool even if it does not follow proper laws of physics. The sequence with a speed boat going up stairs is the same way, except not nearly as cool looking.  
 
Sound:  
 
The acting is pretty good, actually. Hayashibara Megumi is always great. Miki Shinichiro does a good job. Hiramatsu Akiko & Matsumoto Rica are both good. If there's a weakness it's Kaga Takeshi as Kivas. And that's not so much his fault as it is a natural result of him getting a boring character who isn't very expressive. The music works decently enough.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't any. It's not like the Pokemon franchise is going to toss in an Utena reference or something.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Make the villain basically competent. If our heroes had to actually sneak aboard and make their way to his collection, it would make for a more interesting sequence than him just letting them loose without watching them. You could even have Kasumi & Kenji create a distraction so they can actually do something of value.  
Either have all those Pokemon try to interfere with the battle or leave them out. Like I said, the sequences with all of them converging just end up being pointless since they just watch and lick their own genitals.  
Have Doctor Uchikido show some emotion. If the world is ending, you aren't going to look vaguely bored like it's a situation you get every Thursday. There's a difference between composure and just not giving a shit and her reaction is very much not giving a shit.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
If I were watching this as a youngster back when it first came out, I'd probably enjoy it in the moment and quickly forget all the details. Watching it now, however, it does not hold up very well. While it has some good moments and the basic artwork and acting generally work well, the antagonist is forgettable and overly stupid. There are too many ""plot points"" that do nothing and too many characters who sit around scratching their asses. Ultimately, I'll give it a 5/10. It's one of those mundane children's films that has quite a few obvious issues because the writing staff didn't really care or think kids would really notice.

    Probably one of the best Pokémon movies out there. The story was brilliant, an amazing job for Lugia’s voice (dubbed), the art was cool, and all in all, this is one of my favorite movies in the entire series! 
 
And then there’s the Guardian’s song. It made my neck hairs stand, and all I could do was gaze at the television screen. Absolutely majestic.  
 
POKEMON!!!!

    Honestly I find this to be the best of all of the Pokemon movies. And after this, well, they just steadily got worse and worse.  
 
The story was gorgeous, and the music was gorgeous! 
 
I'm giving it 10/10 because, well. That's how I feel about it.  
 
I'm not one to give away spoilers but let's just say this one has to do with the legendary birds and gets really heated and epic. Plus, who doesn't love Lugia? AND LUGIA'S VOICE. Might as well have been Morgan Freeman (in the dub, that is. And I'm not one who usually even likes dubs. Of course I was a kid when I first watched this...)  
 
Amazing.

    EPIC. This has been added to my top animes. An anime has never drawn out so many emotions from me. 
Sunday without God is set in a world where God has suposedly abandoned the world and has granted humans a life on Earth as a dead person. The only people who can bury the dead and put them to rest are gravekeepers.  
This is basically about a 12 year old girl named Ai. She takes on her mother's role of being a gravekeeper after her mother's death. Ai takes it upon herself to save the world and goes through many calamities.  
Story 10/10 - I have to say that the story was gold. It was so creative and enjoyable. Like most animes, I thought I could guess what would happen. Unlike most animes, I was completely wrong. 
I felt like I died a little inside at the end of the 3rd episode, I have never become so attached to a character after just 3 episodes of any show. The ending was just EPIC. It threw me way off and I literally jumped up screaming WHAT. I know a lot of people called it a troll ending but I thought it was something different.   
Animation & music 10/10 - The OP and ED were very good and suited the anime. The background music, along with the angles used were so good, it pulled me right into the anime. 
The animation was really beautiful and crisp. The colours and tones used were perfect and during the sunsets, the yellow wash was magnificent.  
It suited the whole theme of no one being able to die because everyone looked roughly the same age to me, well that's how I interpreted it.  
Characters 9/10 - First up, I have to say that Ai is just so cute. She was such a lovable character.  
I feel like I attached myself to the characters because after the death of a certain character (no spoilers), I  shatered. All the other characters, mains or supporting, were exceptional. The growth of the characters could be seen and that is very important in a good anime to me. 
Overall, 10/10, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I really am looking forward to more. I actually cried during some scenes and I have to say that it's very hard to pull a 10 out of me. I am so drawn to this anime that I have taken it upon myself to read the manga.

    Sign, that was beautiful, totally a very nice drama fantasy, so I'm not gonna f*** around and just present my ratings for this anime: 
 
Story: fair 6. 
 
I kinda like the drama fantasy thing that this 12 episode anime presents, but I find it hard to accept the concept of God abandoning the world, and the people of the world stopped giving birth and the dead becomes zombies that still functions like human and have to be brought down by grave keepers, let's face the story's logic really does contradict  itself, In reality if God were abandons the world, then the end result is Armageddon. But in this anime/manga, the said God here is presented  as this lazy landlord who just lets his grave keepers do the dirty-work and doesn't give a thing as to how things turns up. However, the drama supernatural fantasy is focus on Ai as she goes to one adventure to another, let's face it this anime is compose of 4 adventures that ranges from Ai being with Hampire Hamberg, to Ai being in the city of Ortus, to the great escape from Goran Academy and the mystery of the class of 3-4 in Ostia, and I did like the the end drama where such ending was very touching, but I limit it to such score since one shouldn't ignore this anime's contradicting paradigm. 
 
Art: Poor 3. 
 
Aside from the huge heads and slim body that were ill proportioned , I'm a bit disappointed that there isn't much of fanservice around it.    
 
Sound:   Mediocre 6. 
 
Since there isn't anything for me to comment about it. 
 
 
Character: Fair 6. 
 
Ok, this anime is all about Ai the half human half gravekeeper in fact this anime's 4 part adventure usually composes of various support characters whom are part of each adventure. So I'm just gonna focus on her, I like her sweet and caring characteristics, but I'm a bit annoyed by her being this naive    and being too caring attitude that she really doesn't leave anybody behind even at the risk of the majority, also I'm a bit disappointed that this anime totally places Scar and  Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich as  thirdier characters, thought the two looks good being together, anime director  Yūji Kumazawa could have properly utilize their character to add more to this anime fantasy. genre. 
 
Enjoyment: good 7. 
 
In spite of this anime's contradicting paradigm, it was still enjoyable enough to be viewed as a fantasy drama as the main character Ai goes from one adventure to the next with different support characters and that's that. 
 
Overall: good 7. 
 
Overall it's good since every adventure of this anime has do have a happy ending and that's as good as it gets. 
 
 
Adios muchachos.

    The Sunday Without God is a fantasy type anime that follows Ai Astin, a grave keeper tasked to putting the dead to rest. However, her world is changed when she meets a man named Hampnie. 
 
The anime is set in a world where God has abandoned the world and as such no one can reproduce or fully die. That is, unless a grave keeper puts them to rest. To be clear, people die but become... undead. As they lose their humanity they change into what could be seen more as zombies. However, the undead can live normal lives. If you are wondering, yes it does sound much like Dark Souls. 
 
Probably the most impressive thing the show does is world building. Almost every reveal or aspect of the world that is being built is interesting and adds extra layers to the characters and themes. 
 
One thing I will say is that the first half of the show is much more compelling than second. While a lot of the strengths of the world building and such are still there, the story archs are just not as interesting as the more philosophical elements are not as present later on. It might have to do also that the later episodes seem a lot more cliche and just toss a ton of characters at us instead of focusing on a couple. 
 
It's interesting that Ai is really the only character I would call a main. She is extremely naive and self-righteous about things. To the point where she can become annoying. Each anime arch she meets characters that not only reveal aspects of the world to her but also new ideas that she has not thought about before. 
 
The story is Ai's journey, and as such she has to move on from place to place. This causes some things to feel incomplete. The ending itself feels like a cop out, but is understandable. Surprisingly, some of the characters specific to each arch get more development than the more permanent side characters. There are also some instances where important plot points are not explained (mostly for sake of time.) 
 
The art is stunning. Everything is well detailed and the use of shading and lighting are especially well done. The show is dark when it has to be dark and bright when it needs to be bright. The sound is also pretty good. While not as noticeable as the lighting the bgms are usually well placed and well chosen. Personally I think the OP and ED are good, but nothing to write home about. 
 
The Sunday Without God has some amazing world building and the art quality to represent that. However, it seems like someone abandoned the show half way through as it turns into a bit of a mess of characters and unexplained plot.

    Sunday Without God is a title set in a post-apocalyptic future where the concept of death no longer exists in the world as those who die are no longer able to pass on and those known as Gravekeepers are the only ones who have the ability to allow those among the undead to be put to rest. Ai is one of those Gravekeepers as she learns things in her small village home and a mysterious white-haired man are not as they seem on the surface, being connected to the unique phenomena that has plagued the world of this series. 
 
Before I go on with this review, I would like to comment on this show's major weakness in that it doesn't really do much at addressing major elements to its world. It is never explained how the phenomena within Sunday Without God takes place or how particular people are able to gain supernatural powers, hence requiring viewers to accept things within the series at face value. It's essentially a major storytelling issue that one will have to overlook in order to get the most enjoyment out of this series possible. 
 
Moving on from this, Sunday Without God is focused on Ai journeying throughout the world of her series as she explores how others are affected by the concept of death no longer being within the world and acquiring companions throughout her journey that aid her. Most arcs in the series are meant to serve as an observation of how the societies and characters cope with lacking the ability to pass on, with a major element to this series being that those among the undead for prolonged periods of time can drive one to lose their sanity the longer they remain in the world. The Ortus arc addresses how undead within the series live in a society that they can integrate into without being rejected by those among the living, making for the best arc I seen within the series in its focus on what led so many undead to become part of this society. With its observational focus, the series maintains a neutral viewpoint with how viewers take in what they see through the majority of arcs and doesn't preach for one right or wrong viewpoint. 
 
The only instance a right and wrong viewpoint comes up is during the events of the Goran Academy arc which does cause the series quality to dip to a degree at this point of the series. Beyond this, the only other weaknesses I can remark on with Sunday Without God are that there were some points where I felt there may have been pandering to the audience employed with moments revolving around Ai's naivette and cuteness, as well as the fact that the series lacks a proper ending since the journey of Ai and her companions continues beyond the end of the series as its light novel source material was still ongoing as of the end of the TV anime. 
 
Gripes aside regarding aspects to its storytelling, Sunday Without God is still a solid drama title delving into a world that explores how people handle the idea that they can not pass on once they die and focusing on the companions that Ai gains throughout her journey to better understand the world. It's at least worth a look if you like seeing anime that attempt to tell a worthwhile story without being too pretentious over how it tells it.

    Kamisama no inai Nichiyoubi which is translated as ""Sunday Without God"" just as the title suggest is an anime that is set in a world where there is no God or more like a world abandoned by God.The reason i started to watch it was because of the name and that kawai~ protagonist (i love her ^^ ). 
 
STORY [8/10]: 
The story starts with the arrival of ""Humpnie Hambart"" at the village of our protagonist grave keeper ""Ai Astin"".The story gradually develops from Ai leaving her village, going to the outside world, learning and discovering more about the world and deciding to save the world God has abandoned. 
You should not judge this anime without giving it a try, since as usual as it seems it will give you a one hell of a good experience. 
 
ART [9/10]: 
In anime I give a huge preference to how the art style and animation is and without a doubt this anime deserves a (9/10).The scenes were colorfully magnificent and the protagonists looked so good.the art style was what I'd look for in any anime. 
 
SOUND [6/10]: 
The sound in this anime good.I can't say that i loved them or hated the either but they were fairly good.Although i would not bother to listen to them after i finished this anime. 
 
CHARACTER [7/10]: 
As I have already said I loooooved the protagonist. She was kawai~ and Clumsy and klutzy and kirei-desu. I mean she was so strong and determined that I loved her.The characters Like Scar, Humpmei Hambart, Yuuki, Alice are the only ones i could remember the others did not leave much of an impression.Even we did not get to see much of these characters...I mean I would not mind having given some past of these characters. 
 
Enjoyment [9/10]: 
Having some flaws this anime was the best anime choice that I made at random. I enjoyed watching every moment of it.It was heart warming and easy perceptions story.There were fair amount of friendship and love. 
 
OVERALL [8/10]: 
Overall I loved this anime.The art animation, characters, story and a fair amount of romance made this anime of the good ones for me. 
 
I recommend you try this anime. Arigatō Gozaimashita for reading this review.

    What would you do is one day God abandoned the world and made it so that birth and death no longer existed? No longer would you age or have babies. The only thing waiting was eternal life, even if you never wished for it. Then, one day, people called Gravekeepers come to bury those who have died, making death an option again, but also making it harder for those who wants eternal life. That is Sunday Without God.  
 
Okay, let's get down to business. The story of Sunday Without is very interesting to say the least. It's original, exciting and just full on fascinating. We follow a young Gravekeeper called Ai on her journey to see the world. Along the way she meets many different characters who each have a role they must play in order to live. This story had me from the beginning. It felt like nothing I had seen before, and held me very interested. Though we follow Ai on her journey, there are many smaller stories within the big picture. This is where the story gets a little bumpier. It starts mixing in more and more supernatural elements without really explaining them at all. They're just there. There are also times when I thought they could've removed some parts in favor for explanation. Sometimes it tries to have a more everyday life part of it that didn't really fit the story, and it puts the whole finding out about the world thing to the side, which is a shame. We end up getting little to no explanation as to why God left, why supernatural elements are showing up or anything else for that matter. The story started out with so much potential, but falls a little flat in the end.  
 
The characters are a big part of what drives this story along. Most of them have unique personalities and are very likable, though most of them do not get as much screen time or development as I had wished for, but that is to be expected when the anime is only 12 episodes long. I'm only going to talk about three of the ""main"" characters that we see the most of in order to try to avoid as many spoilers as possible.  
Ai is our adorable main lead. She's a 12 year old Gravekeeper who had lost her mother and been raised by her village instead. She is the only known of her kind since the events of Sunday Without God happens over 12 years after God had left, therefore no child should be as young as she is. She is naive and unaware of how the world truly works, but she is also hard working, slightly spoiled, brave, stubborn and very kind. She's a fun character to follow, and you really grow to like her, though her spoiled nature and stubbornness can get a little annoying. She, sadly, does not get as much development as I would have wished for. She learns through the anime, but it doesn't really change her all that much.  
Then we move on to Julie (male). He's a middle aged man who is out for revenge after his wife was killed and buried when he was out of the house one day. He becomes acquainted with Ai and grow a sort of family bond. He is very dependable, logical and good with a gun. Generally a pretty likable character, though he also does not get all that much development in the end.  
The last person I will talk about is Scar. She is a Gravekeeper who is vastly different from Ai, and more like how Gravekeepers should be. She has a mysterious scar across one of her eyebrows, and her main goal in life is burying the dead and helping mankind. She does not harbor any emotion, but smiles a lot in an almost robot like way. She is also the character that gets the most development oddly enough. She learns a lot from Ai and starts seeing the world differently from how she is ""programmed"" to.  
The side characters all get a decent amount of development and are fun to have around, though some of them are unnecessary or just there to move the plot along. The ones that are more important get a lot of screen time and shows change by the end of their arc. They are usually very unique and memorable, and they each serve a purpose in Ai's journey.  
There is also no actual villain in this anime. Though some of the stories has a bad person that our main protagonists has to fight against, they're pretty forgettable. In the end, their enemy is the world and, kind of, God. It's his fault the world is in the complete chaos that it's in, though he is not seen as a villain either. The anime doesn't really need a villain. It, instead, focuses on the mental challenges the characters had to go through, and that makes for many interesting stories.  
 
The art in this show is stunningly beautiful. It often has a very red and orange or a black and purple layer to it and uses a lot of beautiful contrasts and sharp colors. The backgrounds are amazing and just beautiful to look at, and the design of the world is very beautiful. It had a lot of sunsets and shots of wide landscapes that are just gorgeous to look at. Since the characters are traveling we also get to see many different parts of the world and their contrasts to each other. The post apocalyptic scenery is stunning to look at and very well designed.  
It manages to tone down the more extreme colors when it wants the focus to be on the characters. It also has very pretty character designs where every character looks different from the others, mainly because of the wide use of hair and eye colors. They cleverly use clothes and different heights to make the character unique from each other, and it's easy to see when one person is from another city.  
The animation on the opening is very much like the rest of the anime, using beautiful contrasts and symbolism.  
The ending only pans downwards on a picture of the cast of the anime, and it is a very pretty picture, though it doesn't really do much to get you pumped for the next episode.  
 
Music is always a big part of the anime. The soundtrack to this anime consists of mostly dark, ominous or calming pieces, often using piano, orchestra and choirs to make it sound more suspenseful. There are also some guitar tracks that are very nice to listen to. It is the perfect OST for when you want calming and atmospheric music. Though I wished there was more variation in the OST, what I got was still pretty good.  
The OP is called ""Birth"" by Eri Kitamura. It uses the wonderful trick of making the anime 50% more awesome just by the use of epic choirs, church bells and organ music. When it mixed together with a rock/pop band it becomes very beautiful and fits the anime very well.  
The ED is called ""Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita (I Sang a Never Ending Melody)"" by Komatsu Mikako and is a calm song with mostly piano, though a slightly electronic band starts playing after a while. It uses some english and a fairly strong bass which gives it more energy. The music in this ED often starts playing before the episode is fully over, and it fits very well as background music. It's a calming and beautiful piece.  
 
I enjoyed the heck out of this anime. I loved the world it was set in and really wanted to figure out its mysteries, which left me pretty disappointed when many of these mysteries were left unsolved. It should have had more episodes or a second season, because it definitely needs more explaining. I enjoyed the journey together with Ai and liked most of the story arcs and characters. Each story had a lot of good points and the story was, to a certain point, pretty unpredictable. And I would say it's worth watching just for the beautiful art style.  
 
Overall this was an anime with a lot of potential, though it fell a little flat in the end. There were parts I wished was done better, but what I got was very good and enjoyable. This is an anime for those of you who love a beautiful post apocalyptic setting with a fascinating premise and a cast of fun characters. You must like having several stories within a story and not mind that sometimes the main plot gets put aside for other things. You must also bear that Ai can be annoyingly stubborn and naive, despite her adorableness. If you don't mind this, then you're in for a fascinating and beautiful road trip through a very mysterious world.

    “You shouldn’t have wishes,” when Alis Color mentioned something like this, at first I didn’t understand. What’s wrong with having wishes? But after his reasoning was explained in a later episode, I realized the meaning of those words. Actually, it was at that point I finally realised what this anime was all about. Working hard to make your dreams come true, is what makes life interesting, right? To find the reason why I say this, you should watch Kamisama no Inai Nichyoubi for yourself. 
  
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi or Sunday Without God is set in a world where God abandoned the world 15 years ago on Sunday. The result is a world where nobody dies. This ‘eternal life’ has it’s consequences: people can’t reproduce and the only way to die peacefully is to be burried by a so-called Gravekeeper. Ai Austin is a young girl raised in a beautiful village, when a man called Hampnie Hambert appears before her, who claims to be a ‘man-eating toy’ and of who her deceased mother once told about. A sudden turn of events takes place, which changes the peaceful life Ai has been living until now. After her village is destroyed, Ai is destined to travel the vast, unknown world in a quest to save it. But saving the world with people who all look differently at this world, and is filled with dilemmas, isn’t easy. The somewhat heavy themes and dilemmas make this story very interesting. The storytelling is great and as we follow Ai, who knows equally as much as we do (let’s say nothing) about this world, we discover more and more about the world. And when you think you know the situation, it appears something completely different. With each problem solved, more questions arise. The great plottwist and mysteries make this a thrilling show, and each episode you wonder what will happen next. 
  
The art in this anime is brilliant. Beautiful colors, detailed surroundings and lovely characterdesigns. The animation looks fluent and great camerawork that makes the more intense scenes really stand out. The soundtrack accompanying the scenes is great as well and gives the show the right atmosphere, from heartwarming to emotional moments. I loved both opening and ending, and the voices fit really well with the characters. I have nothing more to say about this. 
  
The heroine Ai Austin is a lovely, but naïve girl and her reactions seem a bit stupid sometimes, but if you think about the way she is raised until recently, it’s completely understandable. Her being bewildered by the new experiences, wanting to save everyone even though that’s impossible and pondering over the dilemma’s what everyone would do…everything makes sense. Her character development is slow, but the subtle changes are there. The other character’s thoughts and reasonings are well explored too and that makes them realistic. Their backgrounds are often sad and I have shed some tears over them during the show. 
  
I like this kind of anime really quickly. Maybe it’s a bit singleminded, but I consider this a masterpiece, simply because it touches a sensitive chord in me and that’s very important when I watch or read a story. After every episode I kept wondering about the situation, and tried to find my own answer to the vital questions popping up while watching the show. The ending solved the issues well, making me tearful (yes, I cry very easily) but satisfied. Yet there are many questions left unanswered and I hope there will be some answers in the 13th episode which will air later, or hopefully in a sequel. I loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi very much! 
  
I hope you’re all working hard to reach your goals, because that’s the only way to make your dreams become reality. And live your life to the fullest to be happy, rather than to wish for an eternal life.

    Started out strong, it went downhill from there.  
 
With the exception of 1 episode the structure of this show is 2-3 episode arcs, which i imagine are the length of one of the series light novels each. I love this format, and the first two arcs are fantastic, exactly what i expected from the show. We are introduced to a great main character who is thrown into extreme circumstances and we are introduced to two (although quite bland) supporting cast members. Each new arc brings new characters into play, this is both a blessing and a curse, in the beginning this is fantastic, by the end it starts to get annoying. Its sad because the first 6 episodes were so good, lots of flashbacks, a more complex story about our protagonist trying to understand her past, by the end, this is sidelined for a whack sub-plot about a charter you don't really care about in the whole scheme of things. This is meant to be dark, and it started out dark, it is meant to be funny, it was in the beginning, it is meant to be epic, it was in the beginning. Maybe if there is a second season this will be resolved and the larger themes and plot lines brought back into the forefront, i hope so. The animation was mixed, i like the style of it, lots of shadow and light but at times it just seemed rather cheap unfortunately. Great soundtrack. Great character development in the beginning, by the end, not so much.

    I watched this anime because one of my friends recommended it. Since it was short I gave it a shot and I really don't regret it. It's a pretty great anime. Hence why I gave it a 9 overall.  
 
Story: 8/10 
 
I think it's a pretty original plot. In the sense, I've never thought about ""What if God abandoned the world."" It really makes you wonder how people would react and in the anime, you get all sorts of views. Each character has their own opinion about the world after God abandons it. Not only that but they give out their reasoning and it really makes you think as well as understand why the characters do what they do and how it's made them to be.  I really liked the arcs within this series and I think this anime could've gone longer if not for the ending. The ending left me with more questions than answers but it makes me want to pick up the novel for it so that's what I'll do. I do recommend this anime though. 
 
Art: 9/10 
 
The art was beautiful. The way they made movements flow along together. Bodies weren't exaggerated so I didn't have to see huge boobs flying at me mid-screen. There was an abundance of colors and it felt very beautiful. It made me think sort of like watching the sun rise and then set. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
LOVED THE MUSIC! The ED and OP were so befitting of the anime. The opening is a great entrance to the anime and it's right on topic too.  It wasn't super upbeat but it had a great tune that gave sort of a mysterious touch. The ED was a great closure to watch every time. Soft and smooth enough to give a comfortable feeling. Kinda a bittersweet feeling. The music played during the anime was very touching. Pianos, opera-like music ...all beautiful. No song felt out of place during the anime and it didn't randomly start at scenes are hit with high notes that it'd scare you.  
 
Character: 9/10 
 
The characters were quite different and their construction was restricted to their world and their actions. Each character had their purpose and they influenced one another through their abilities and understanding of the world. The way they interacted through love or friendship seemed very realistic to me. Not counting any magical usage, the characters seemed to be on top. Though I believe the main character could've used a bit more development by the end of the series, I didn't hate any characters. That's pretty rare as I usually have at least ONE character I hate. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
Watched the anime in roughly two days because I enjoyed it so much. Everything blended together so I really liked it. Probably shouldn't have watched it before a midterm though...but it proves how much I enjoyed it. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
It's a great anime with wonderful music (seriously....WONDERFUL music) and story. It could be A LOT more if not for some initial errors but there's always answers in novels/mangas and such. Definitely worthy to pick up if you want to pass some time or just enjoy a good brain picker.

    Sunday Without God is my favourite anime of all time, for the simple reason that it is presented with captivating beauty and passion. 
 
Beautiful is the word that comes to mind with Sunday Without God.  
 
In an artform where presentation is key, Sunday Without God nails it perfectly. For me, every frame is a lush watercolour painting, with dazzling hues of orange and purple. The soundtrack is magical, accompanying each scene with just the right touch of atmosphere.  
 
It is difficult to do the surrealness of the show's landscapes any justice with prose alone, so if you have been kind enough to read this far, perhaps consider searching up the OP or an AMV on Youtube? I do believe that few would not be pleasantly surprised by the amount of love dedicated to tracing out every line, shading in the various tints of colour. 
 
The premise is unique, to say the least, depicting a world where humans have stopped reproducing; akin to the famed Children of Men, though with a decidedly different (and one I personally enjoyed more) take on the matter. The writing is certainly fascinating, although short of being absolutely spectacular. It is, however, definitely a breath of fresh air - the show serves up generous doses of originality with its creative takes on common plot points, such as time loops and imprisonment, and certainly wastes no time with needless pandering. 
 
Perhaps the greatest charm is the protagonist, Ai - the only child in a world robbed of childbirth, humanity's greatest gift. She captures all the hope and beauty left in a world that ""God abandoned"", and this brightness shows through in every scene she's in. Her innocence allows even heavier themes, such as death and ostracism, to be handled in a warm and positive, yet thoughtful way. 
 
Plot criticism may be centered around the show's naiivety, where nothing explicitly bad ever happens to anyone in the main cast, evil and malice are nonexistent, and love and warmth reign supreme. The way I see it, this is the show's merit - it must be seen as a children's storybook. 
 
Sunday Without God does not claim to be a thematic masterpiece that tackles and deconstructs controversial issues, nor does it see itself as an idea-intensive show for the thinking man, or an overly plot-heavy or character-driven tour de force. It is, if anything, a picture book - a work of not art, nor any great educational significance, but a work of beauty. To be appreciated, to be caressed, to be loved. I cannot fault the show for not having a gripping plot, or complex and dynamic characters, or not fully exploring its unique premise - that is not its intent. Sunday Without God is not an ambitious show by any stretch. It is a heartwarming, simple tale that is a treat for the senses. 
 
Therefore, a word of forewarning: one might be disappointed, or even frustrated, by the show if one is expecting anything novel, thrilling, or overly intelligent. In my mind, the show was made for the sole purpose of being enjoyed, and if one seeks to be soothed, to be comforted, to be warmed, then Sunday Without God is undoubtedly one of the best anime out there. 
 
Ultimately, anime, as an artform, is unique because it transcends the limits of film and television even with the advent of CGI, and rare is the show where this key quality shines through. Anime, for me, can tell a story with an easy, yet almost surreal beauty that other mediums cannot, presenting a fantasised version of a world that is hauntingly beautiful. It makes the world look more perfect and beautiful than it ever can in the real world; it is fantasy in its purest form, and this show knows this. 
 
Sunday Without God doesn't capture the mind, nor does it want to - it captures the heart, and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside.

    This is one of those cases when the synopsis, while being absolutely correct, seems to promise a completely different experience from the one you're about to get. I went into this series expecting a plot driven show where most of the intrigue comes from the world itself, which seemed the case early one, since the beginning of the show focuses on the world's rules, people being unable to die, the Gravekeepers and whatnot. Later on, though, attention starts being shifted to character exploration and eventually Ai, the lead, just flat out says she has completely forgotten about her role as a Gravekeeper. 
 
So, if one were eager to get a coherent narrative filled with mysteries and coming to its ultimate resolution in the end, they'd be pretty disappointed to see this show consists of a number of subplots connected mostly by Ai's determination to save the world, no less, which leads to a road trip of sorts. Luckily, these subplots and characters they focus on were more than enough to keep me invested in what was happening, also helped by the fact that there's little to no filler, all the episodes feel as an essential part of the story. In the end it resembles Cloud Atlas done right: the subplots are similarly connected by one main theme, namely, dreams and wishes, but there's no obvious message that can be clearly tracked through most of the parts, in fact, different points of view are represented and, in the end, none are completely discarded. 
 
Surprisingly for a show that consists of a handful of pretty much separate stories, there are not so many significant characters here but they are well written and none feel unidentifiable, although there is a guy who's simply boring. Some are straightforward, some evolve throughout the series (Ai, in particular), some end up being not quite what they seemed - all that good stuff is here. The twists (and there are a couple) are genuinely well done and the stories are interesting, each shedding some light on what did God abandoning Earth really mean and the consequences of this event. The ending gives somewhat of a conclusion to Ai's desire but leaves many things open for interpretation, which I always like. 
 
The artwork is simply gorgeous, it's drawn in clear lines and colored beautifully. There are some effects, particularly later on, which also look fantastic. The main character managed to look as a generic young girl yet still be unique at the same time. Hell, the chief animator's other credits include working on Death Note, which, although extremely controversial, is also extremely beautiful, so it figures. Bottom line - this anime looks great. Voice acting is also very good. Nothing much to say here, it's just good. As it usually is with this particular aspect, there isn't much to comment on except if there are some unusual tricks, flaws or just very-well recognizable voices. That's not the case. 
 
This anime explores an interesting and, to be honest, underutilized theme of dreams and wishes (at least I think it does). Seriously, it was mostly covered in Disney animated movies (and knockoffs of those but that's a sad story), and in a largely stupid way. They promised that dreams come true. This show, in return, asks: ""Well, is it good?"".  A fine question with no clear answer; add some great animation, interesting plots and identifiable characters and voila - you get Sunday Without God (English title). A cocktail I was happy to try out, might I add.

    Story: In a world that human cannot die properly unless you are buried by special undertakers is messed up, especially since the undertaker is a young girl with an innocent mind of a young girl. And this fact is quickly unnecessary after the beginning part of the anime.  
 
Art & Music: But nevertheless, the art and music in this anime are really good. Art was beautiful and the ending was one of my favourite anime ending song.   
 
Character: Can't really say I was interested in the main character, Ai, and the supporting characters weren't really memorable as well, but they weren't  bad as well. And Ai was cute (not a lolicon). 
 
Enjoyment: Personally, I really enjoyed this anime, it had beautiful arts, great ending song, and.... Feels. It really hits you hard because you didn't see it coming, and the ending song just added fuel to the fire. 
 
Overall: Recommended to watch Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi if you like to watch anime with non flesh eating undeads, undertakers blessed by God, and lolis. Or you can watch it for the beautiful arts, feels and an ending song to make you cry for hours.

    How can we truly perceive the world around us? The answer is: we can't. It's impossible for a human being to understand what is actually going on around him, because what he really sees is just what his brain interprets. Everyday people make new discoveries, everyday another person comes to realize something new about themselves and the world he is surrounded by, but we aren't getting any closer to understanding the questions that have been bugging us since the beginning of humanity's development. However, all that would never be possible in the first place, if we didn't set goals for ourselves, if we didn't dream about something bigger, something better, something that we more than likely won't ever reach through any normal means. Even if we know that some things are completely out of our reach at that exact point in time, we still wish for those things. That's what defines humanity. And this is a show about setting those goals, followed by the never ending search of any means to reach them, and completing small objectives on the road that it takes us. One of those goals might just be saving the world, another one could be understanding it. 
Ladies and gentlemen - Sunday without God, a series that while being seriously flawed at some moments, was able to provide ME with a tale that I could fully comprehend from the beginning to the ending, and one that was able to achieve one of those normally unachievable goals it set in front of itself. That goal was pretty simple: give the viewer a freedom of interpretation and understanding this story in his own way, while still providing enough entertainment, plot twists and philosophical questions to make him think about it for days. 
Incredibly simple right? (*Sarcasm alert*) 
 
I will be referring to this series either by ""Kamisama"", ""Sunday without God"" or ""Kaminai"" throughout this review. 
*Incredibly slight spoilers inside* 
 
Story: 9 
Sunday without God constantly brings something special to the table, with an unique premise, setting, and ideas at every new step. It is impossible to talk about the actual plot without spoiling a single thing, so instead of that, I want to talk about the appreciation I have for the care that the original creator put into his work. 
Kaminai is his first project, and throughout the show I could feel the passion that was put into the story. The light novel that it is based off of is his first work as an author, but it doesn't go as far as his later reimaginations. I'm pretty certain that the idea of the show just popped into his head one day, and he rolled with it, creating a story around it, adding additional characters and arcs that he then released in the form of a manga and later into an anime. I feel like this is the case because of the way that the story revolves around the main character, Ai, or more specifically, around the previously mentioned journey and the objectives she completes along the way. Each arc that I saw influences her way of thinking. She starts off by finding her dream, but the way in which she wants to do achieve it changes after more influential events. That's why her journey leads her to explore the world she lives in and understand the communities she encounters. Arc after arc, character after character I could witness completely different ways of utilizing the setting to its maximum, it wasn't afraid to ask hard hitting questions or propose unpopular ideas. The show itself never takes a stance and it never states that a way of dealing with the dilemmas that the characters face is correct or wrong. Everything is a gray area in a world without God, and I love it. Stories that give me the freedom of interpretation and don't throw its meaning at my face TOO often tend to be some of my favorites. And not only that, but the amount of options from which I could choose was pretty large. Let me put it like this: If I was to be put into that world, in the same time as the events of the anime take place, even knowing the entire plot I would still have to think hard about how to approach my way of living, about what side will I take in some conflicts and what goal would I set for myself. Not because there wasn't enough information provided, but because those dilemmas are so multisided, none of them are clean and easy answers. 
I was also pleasantly surprised by how alive the world felt with all its emptiness. The characters often stumble upon someone in the middle of nowhere, the entire setting feels like its truly moving. Even when a group is left behind, the thought that they are going to live their lives somewhere in that world persisted. That could be contributed to the values that the main characters bring to that community. They aren't groundbreaking, but they're impactful, they don't change their ideals, but change their approach and so on. 
Ideals can't make a good story though. What a show needs first and foremost, is a good structure: the pacing, progression and such. Several shows that I watched weren't able to overcome these basics, but aimed higher than most anime out there. Sunday without God thankfully does those things well. At no point is it stagnant, even in the more relaxed parts it is still able to be insightful. That's not to say that a show doesn't need moments that don't progress the story and instead build the connection between the viewer and the characters, but when you can mix them with small hints or make them have a strong message it makes them this much more memorable. Not only that, but It's also able to slow down or speed up the pace when it wants to. However, with all that being said.... 
Even if I do consider this to be one of my favorite anime stories, and even if I do consider most of the writing to be exceptional, I can't help but notice that this anime has a serious problem with reaching finales, at least in the first two arcs. This is another thing that leads me to believe that the author created everything around one idea. It seems like he really wanted to have a couple of specific elements included in his story, but didn't really know how to go about adding them  without breaking the flow. This may be the reason for some serious mistakes taking place. They prevent this part from being rated as a ten. One of the examples is including some characters with a supposed backstory, that we learn about only briefly, just so they can serve a purpose of being plot elements, without which some of the most touching and impactful scenes would have less meaning than they actually do. Is it a bad thing? Yes, of course it is. I don't think that a character thrown into my face as a plot element will be one that I'll remember fondly. Does it influence the story in a major way? No. It does influence the story, don't get me wrong, but not to the point where it breaks its flow or the overarching theme of the series. Since those two elements were the most important ones here, at least for me, I didn't think they were as bad as I normally would see them being. 
As for the ending, my train of thought leads to believe that it was all set up exactly the way it was supposed to. If you would disagree with me, I would definitely see where you're coming from. Yes, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, however it's meaning leaves me completely satisfied. It ends on the perfect point in the story, that, because of it's themes and direction, made chills run down my spine. 
I like to think of myself as some sort of an advocate of people who find personal meaning in any piece of artistic work more important than the quality, that's because I went through that experience  as well. I, just like those people, am able to overlook several mistakes if they don't tarnish my experience. However, I don't think this is the reason why I thought the story deserves this much praise. I genuinely think it was masterfully created so that the viewer can find his own way of understanding it and possibly finding something about himself, something that he wouldn't be able to find otherwise. The means of achieving this goal are a bit shady at times, but I can't argue with the results. I have yet to find a better utilized post apocalyptic setting in anime, maybe even in any media. 
 
Characters: 6 
Unlike the story, the characters aren't explored particularly well, and yet I somehow feel like it was done on purpose. The story itself relies heavily on symbols, there's not a single thing that holds no meaning or no value to its themes. Characters are no exception, they're symbols that represent ideas and viewpoints. For example, Ai, the main heroine, is a daughter of a gravekeeper and a human. She represents two different ideals that her parents carried and the hope for the destroyed world. She is probably the most developed and interesting character thanks to that. She constantly develops her mindset, every key event has an effect on her way of thinking, which leads to her getting lost at times. 
The rest of the cast serve exactly the same purpose. Humpnie is a representative of people who believe that the dead should stay dead, Ai's mother represents people who dream about creating heaven on Earth, Yuri is just a guy who tried to live happily in the situation he was placed in and Scar, as an usual Gravekeeper, is the carrier of the world's future. Not to mention the characters that pop in later. 
Actually, I think ""pop in"" is a good way of describing character introduction here. It just sort of happens, I never really felt like they did it properly. Some characters were also introduced just to disappear for the rest of the series. Despite that, the strongest asset of the cast is everything that happens with them after the introduction. They really feel well utilized and well implemented into the world and its topics. None feel repetitive, and while some are barely glanced over, others bring huge improvement and add even more psychological depth to it. That's why even though the series rarely expands on its rather large cast, I still feel like they all did their job fairly well. 
Their interaction at times feel more realistic than at others. There are groups and pairs that clearly have better chemistry, but because of that the rest feel like they're put aside for the sake of those shining brighter. It would be nice if they could  balance it out and create a more memorable cast, but it is what it is I guess. 
I wouldn't say the show has a bad or forgettable cast, far from it, but I think that it's only because of their place in the story. I don't think I would care about them as much as I did on their own, or if they were a part of any other anime. Simply put, the story compliments the characters far more than the other way around. Kaminai is a heavy, story focused show, but that doesn't mean that it can be used as an excuse for some slightly, but noticeably, lacking characters. 
 
Music and Visuals: 8,5 
Another strong aspect of the series is that it's set in France of all places. This leads to some pretty interesting choices in its music, world design and character designs. That's why I'm grouping the visuals and music together, they truly feel like a one big entity that is created solely for the purpose of setting the mood. Everything looks pretty different compared to other anime. The characters travel through grassy fields, mountain roads, small cities with gothic looking churches in them and even small castles, very smoothly on top of that. Their designs, while a bit over the top at times, with the bright colored hair, look solid and deviate from the usual anime norm. The music is often slow and ambient, but it can change depending on the situation. Everything does feel like it is set in destroyed Europe, which feels nice. We don't see this part of the world covered nearly enough in anime, or at least I don't. 
The directing isn't the best by no means, but it has its moments. It can do beautiful things if it wants to, some scenes can be meaningful and set up pretty well with some really well animated moments, and most of the time the music doesn't stay behind as well as it compliments both the place the scene is taking place at and its mood. It's a well coordinated show in that regard. 
On its own, the soundtrack is genuinely beautiful. It's calming and poignant, with some tracks like ""Blessing"" and ""Lost World"" creating some of the best atmosphere I've ever felt while listening to an anime OST. The opening and the ending songs really represent the way I felt about the series. They switch between a fast and a slow pace, use a lot sounds that make them feel magical and even tear jerking. They also always end on the slower part, just like the series did. The OP uses a choir that can be heard throughout its entirety, which does strengthen the feeling of the religious themes the show presents. The ED starts of really slow and later starts to bring in hopeful, louder sounds to, by the end of it, feel like it was always a happy song all along. Overall, it's a very well thought out soundtrack that really does strengthens the series. 
Same could be said about the art work, or at least about the backgrounds. You could probably take half of the larger shots in this series and turn them into wallpapers, and while that's some truly outstanding work, the stuff that you see on the regular is ""only"" good. Comparing them to the prettier scenes in the series, they don't seem to receive the same amount of care. There's even some CGI involved, it's not that bad, but it shows that several compromises had to be made. Overall, I do think that the art style is good, and the animation is always fluid, but it's not perfect by no means. 
So, on the audiovisual side Kaminai is a spectacle to behold. It's able to look good, while still being able to present its symbols clearly and never being too pushy or pretentious about it the same time. I can truly appreciate that. To be honest this could be expected, Madhouse rarely disappoints in that regard. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Nowadays, any anime that tries to be thought inducing leaves me with a bit of a bad aftertaste. Either because of the themes not being utilized in a meaningful way, that would help the series be more than it was, or because of writing putting the characters into inhumane levels of profoundness, or because of the core and the basics are not good enough to even justify trying to achieve that. Kamisama doesn't do any of that. I felt the impact that the journey had on the characters without it ever feeling overly slow or overly fast. People over at Madhouse were able to create some of the its themes so well, that it got me thinking about it for days, both during and after the time I watched it. While being away from my computer screen I constantly think about this show and its story. I feel like it influenced my way of thinking in some way, made me more aware of the things I'll have to go through in life and helped me think about my stance on them. There's something to be said when a series that at first looked so simple, that I picked up as something to pass my free time with, is able to create such a connection between its themes and my life. I can say that it definitely won't have the same effect on everyone, it's not like you are at the same point in your life that I am, neither did you have the same life I did up to this point. SO, is it more of a personal series? Yeah, I'd say so. It became one of my favorite anime for those reasons. If you find its topics to be interesting or influential to you personally, then you may find it to be pretty good as well. I'll wrap this up with a quote from the series itself. 
""We simply cannot see the world as it is. The world people see is nothing more than how our brains translate it. In other words, it's subjective."" 
 
Overall: 8,5 
Sunday without God feels like a very underrated anime to me. I can see why it has the score that it has (sitting at 7.52 at the time of this review being written), the somewhat rushed characters and several hardly noticeable story elements scattered around for the reason of explaining the convoluted setting definitely can annoy many people out there, but I'm sure that if they would look at the hints that the show leaves some of the plot inconsistencies would disappear. I believe that the show doesn't have to say something straight to my face for me to understand it, and while I don't think doing so is wrong in some situations, I don't think Kamisama needed it. This is a story of a world, in which wishes are the strongest driving force for the remaining humans traversing it. Bigger or smaller, those dreams let them understand more than they ever could comprehend when the show started. Just like I did. the show really felt more meaningful when I noticed that it leaves those slight nudges for the viewer to catch. With those pieces I created a coherent picture, in which I don't see any holes left. Would this show benefit from more episodes? Yes, without a doubt it could get rid of all those doubts that I had, but I think it's more fun this way. What I got is a solid piece of work that could branch into multiple different directions if it only wants to do so in my head, and that's exactly why I love this show. I feel like this world is still open for me, so I can explore it in my imagination and in my dreams, but Ai's story feels complete. That's why I will defend it to death. If you ever feel like watching this show, I do recommend it. Maybe, just maybe, you'll find something for yourself, albeit I can't promise that. 
Is this score unbiased? No, of course it isn't, just like any other score on this website. If you made it this far into the review, then you probably realized it by now. This series doesn't avoid mistakes, but I don't think it needed to. Sometimes shows with flaws can feel more charming than those that avoid them. I don't think that everyone who thinks this show is bad is an idiot, neither do I think higher of myself because I saw more in it. All I can say is that from now on every Sunday will remind me of this show. All the things this anime showed me will not be forgotten, I can at least guarantee you that. 
It's not like that's important to you or anything, but I really wanted to say it. 
 
As always this is purely my opinion. I encourage you to develop your own.

    Okay so Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi had my hopes high. 
The concept of god disappearing was interesting and the setting seemed cool. 
But oh boy was I disappointed. 
 
Story 31/100 
 
The original concept is interesting and was the thing that got me to watch this series originally. 
 For the first 6 episodes they explored the concept and had some kind of story going on which was pretty enjoyable but suddently, halfway into the anime they just switch story and introduce a ton of new characters that you'll just see in 2 episodes and then they'll never be seen again.  
It really feels like the creators didn't know what they wanted with this anime and tried first making it a dystopian-fantasy anime, then switched to a school-fantasy and then last they switched to a drama-fantasy setting.  
Feels like a lot of wasted potential from the original idea. 
 
Art 75/100 
 
The art was enjoyable, probably the series only strong point except for it's OST. 
 Character design was for the most part pretty bland but some characters actually stood out a little bit. The MCs design was nice and some other charactters were pretty well designed.  
The enviroments and backgrounds were beautiful and I have nothing to complain about with it. 
 
Sound 77/100 
 
The OST was very good and by far the most enjoyable thing with the series. 
The opening was not bad but it felt like something that you've heard a lot of times before, in other words pretty generic.  
Overall the background music was beautiful, gave a nice touch to the world they we're in and made the enviroments feel alive. 
 
Character 32/100 
 
The series weakest point together with the plot.  
Most of the characters were COMPLETELY unmemorable and I don't even recall one moment I genuinely sympathised with them.  
The MC was the only one I cared for but not even in a deep way. 
In the last 4 episodes the series kinda puts aside the MC to introduce 2 new characters and for the last episodes their story is the one that is in focus.  
I don't know what they were trying to do when they created this anime, it's far too few episodes to start something new and especially when they are the last episodes of the whole anime. 
A lot of times the characters did things that contradicted the laws and rules that the series had created for it self, and you'll wait for an explanation why they were able to do it but.... no! No explanations, the characters don't even bother talking about it. 
 
Enjoyment 35/100 
 
If you just look past the plot holes, not relatable characters, non consistent plot and just not use your brain for 5 hours I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy this anime.  
I myself like animes with plots that are consistent, relatable and interesting characters and a setting that spans over 12 episodes. 
I can't say I hated watching it but I can't really say I enjoyed it that much. 
The only reason I kept watching was to hope that they just make something good and EXPLAIN something with the last episodes. 
 
Overall 41/100 
 
+Art was good 
+Soundtrack was good 
 
-Plot holes galore 
-Bland characters 
-Non existing/consistent plot

    Warning: This review will contain (limited, but possibly deal-breaking) spoilers.  I feel it impossible to explain myself without delving into the story specifics. You have been warned. 
 
I will skip the summary, I assume you have it at the top of the page. Suffice to say, the undead, no more babies, and a little Gravekeeper three years too young to exist, Ai.  As my other reviews show, while animation and mood are nice, I focus on acting and story. So this will slant in those directions. For that reason, you will find I am rather negative. 
 
I am not someone who has read the book series, so when Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (hereafter KIN) popped up on the season's list, I was intrigued.  I didn't quite know what to expect. I purposefully approached the series on its own merits, without research about the background, to let the show stand on its own. I am always of the opinion I should not have to do homework to enjoy a work.  There was but a brief description about the premise, and color me interested, I tuned in the very first week. 
 
After the first few episodes, I wanted this show to blow everything else out of the water. I wanted to LOVE this show.  I wanted to parade this series around come the fall like it was the next Fullmetal, or Death Note, or Madoka.  It very early on demonstrated a theme of ""hope within absolute darkness"".  It had little girl tea-party heartwarming alongside the living dead. Ai was a fantastic character, really every character is fantastic. This show was going places.  I was sad at the end of the Humphney Humbert arc, but who wouldn't be? But I was left with a complete sense of....contentment. KIN had an excellent pace, and seemed to know exactly where to put its focus. The art was beautiful, eerily beautiful for a show about (essentially) the twilight of humanity. The music was spot on, and voice actors perfectly cast. Of all the series I was watching (some five), KIN was at the top of my list, the one I anxiously stood on edge for to see next week. 
 
The second arc was similarly splendid. It elaborated on the themes of the HH arc.  It built on that Ai being a Gravekeeper was a splendid thing. And in Ortus, it was a dangerous thing. The kingdom of the dead.  It was a natural development in the consequences of such a world.  It was excellent political development without bashing you over the head. Things were strange to our eyes, with fascinating culture of the dead (like the wearing of Venetian masks to hide the decay of flesh, an unspoken but fascinating concept), and here we learned of the true power of wishing, and that prayers of those close to death seemed to come true.  I was still excited for KIN. I still held it up high. 
 
But at that point, the structure broke down.  And it's not hard to see where things went wrong. In the tug of war between remaining faithful to the books, and telling a good story for TV, it was the books that won.  The series is divided into four arcs. Each one, I presume (again, having not read the books, but judging from the pace) was based on an individual book.  While this keeps the material fresh, and avoids hammering the same points over and over, and we see the characters grow perhaps more than we might have, it leaves the short series, a mere 12 episodes, without focus.  The Humpney Humbert arc and Ortus arc were connected. Not tightly, but they built off previous themes and expanded on the logic of the universe.  The School arc mostly existed to explore the concept of wishing. It introduced us to Dee and Alice, who would be the main characters in the Bubble World arc, but Ai's status as a Gravekeeper was little more than a flimsy pretense to drag her into the school. After that, it was never important.  There was no sense of how this little girl would meet, and pass, or fail, the challenge that came with ""saving the world"".  The Bubble World arc was almost its own series entirely. Even Ai doesn't notice when her shovel goes missing, so absent is the ""important"" job of being a Gravekeeper from the front line that it seems almost superfluous to the entire show by the end.  We get the sense that Ai is a special child, but not because of her Gravekeeper status. This could have worked for the series, but the disconnect between pieces leaves much to be desired. 
 
As difficult as it is to say, I would rate this series almost within a ""dramatic slice of life"" category.  While there is episode-to-episode continuity, there is no real feeling of change beyond characters entering and exiting.  Scar almost seems to come along because we needed an extra butt filling a seat, and even then she and Yuri are mostly shoved aside after the Ortus arc. The two characters who seemed to be role models to Ai at the beginning, one who would teach her to be a Gravekeeper, and one who would teach her to be Human, really didn't do anything besides be old enough to drive.  Which is a shame because they both have such interesting backstories and personalities. They kept getting shoved aside for guest stars, and when Dee and Alice show up it seems like we traded out old models for new ones. 
 
Ai herself changes little. She goes from seeing ""the world is this way"" to ""okay, the world is not this way, but it should be""  The problem is that, while this is growth, this growth is complete by episode 4. She then halfway reboots, paying lip service to the previous lessons, but still holding on to her naivete. Only in the Bubble World does she seem to have a more worldly view that things are happy, but wrong, but this change doesn't seem to come -from- anything. 
 
On the whole, KIN's strengths are in its concepts, and its flaws are in its execution. A world without traditional death, and with Gravekeepers, who seem to be some organic AI? Fascinating.  Number of times that is relevant to the series? Three. And one is monologued at us. A kingdom of the dead, the true realization of Ai's mother's hopeful dream? Wonderfully shot, beautifully animated, but there are no true consequences of this visit.  An organization that seeks to check the power of the prayer? Could be truly interesting. But came off as little more than stuffy old people being mean old people.  A bubble world where someone died, yet still had a wish fulfilled? A few -hours- difference that strains credulity? Never even brought up. Scar, a Gravekeeper who is good natured, yet heartless in her pursuit of duty? We are told this, and it is conveniently side-stepped in Ortus, and never comes again.  Or her later transformation into something more sapient? Nothing. Yuri, a man who lost his family, and really only takes in Ai at the beginning of some misplaced sense of responsibility for the death of his daughter and his love/hate relationship with Humphney? Not important. 
 
While all these issues CAN be put off in a lengthy book series, they are woefully crippling to a 12 episode anime. A series can not be entirely about set-up, there has to be some rolling resolution to go along with the introduction of all the elements.  Perhaps that is not possible. Perhaps the books themselves limit the continuation, but I cite Fullmetal Alchemist, which took the identical starting material, and made their own conclusions.  Conclusions that some people find superior (though I am not among them). This series had ways to avoid the four-arc trap. They could have focused more heavily on two, they could have stayed loyal and halfway in, diverted from continuity.  They could have merely edited the ending to tie all four chaotic arcs together (there was an easy way). 
 
In summary, out of everything this season, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was, personally, my biggest disappointment for summer 2013. If its mission was to interest me in one day picking up the novels? Sure. I'd say it succeeded, if only to find out.  If it was to be an entertaining show I could recommend? It falls just short. I can't bring myself to call it anything more than average. Watch it if it intrigues you, by all means. But if you're looking for that next special series, I, grudgingly, must vote that you move along.

    	Just when I thought fantasy animes couldn’t come up with an original story, I was mistaken. I started this series without any expectations but somehow, I already had the idea that I won’t be taken by surprise. Apparently, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi isn’t one to play things like others do and I believe it deserves a better reception than it has. 
 
	It may not seem like it from the surface, but the story is quite deep to a certain level. Not only is it complex, but it did as much as to influence my perspective in life. Simply said, the story is rich in ideas and philosophies. The progression is flawless considering that three unique plots transitioned smoothly between each other for a length of twelve episodes. Events happened in a quick pace and some minor details that would have otherwise clarified everything else were skipped but they’re not necessarily rushed. I was also amazed by how each arc presented a totally new story without compromising the delivery. In addition, nothing is uninteresting and unengaging.  
 
	On the other hand, the characters were very likeable despite how I found them to be nearly common as to the rest. Nevertheless, in a short span of time, I became fond of the main character’s qualities of kindness, innocence, and courage. The other supporting characters felt close too. It was also surprising how a lot of characters played important roles and greatly contributed to the development of the series. 
 
	Not only was the story made well but as well as the overall art. The visuals consisted of stunning sceneries that is shown even from the very first episode. The music used were perfect and did well to amplify the emotions intended. The ending theme was my favorite and I love how it starts to play at the last scenes of the episode before entering the credits.  
 
	To sum up, everything from the anime is enjoyable – the story, mystery, conclusions, music, art and appealing characters. The only problem I found with the anime is that I wasn’t fully satisfied with all of it that I’m wanting for more because unfortunately, the anime is too short. It’s a good thing that even though I only enjoyed it for a short while, it’s still a memorable one. Whenever you decide that you to experience the entertainment of fantasy as if it was your first time, then give Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi a try!

    The story of a girl named ''Ai'' who is half human and have grave keeper. 
 
This anime is about dead people and ghost. If you don't like stories about the dead you might not like this one. The story is mainly a girl who is have grave keeper, grave keepers are the ones who dig people when there dead to make them leave the world in peace. ''Ai'' finds out that her town is filled with dead people... as she starts her new journey with scar a full grave keeper and a friend of her fathers.  
  
In this journey she makes new friends and helps people  both dead and alive be happy.  
 
The characters are very fun and have great personalities that suit them well.  
 
In general if you like a calm, interesting anime that's nice to watch if your having a  relaxing day and that is related to deaths  i think this is a pretty great one.

    this deserves a full 10 on everything.  
the plot was unlike anything ive seen before and so unique it had me hooked the first episode.  the main character ai is only 12 yet she certainly doesnt act her age. shes very independent and has been through a lot,i admire her for that.  
the artwork was beautiful and no lazy animation was done. the characters fit really well together how they were drawn. the opening and ending song fit the anime really well it had this mysterious sound to it.  the main characters showed a lot of development while the side ones didnt really develop i guess thats ok though. i finished this in less than a day and enjoyed every episode. some episodes were very emotional and sad but thats why i loved it. the ending tricked me because just as i was about to loose it... c:  at first i thought i wouldnt like this anime but i gave it a shot and ended up putting it at the top of the list for my favorites. i really hope there is a second season because there is still so much unanswered.

    First of all I'm sorry if i include a little bit spoilers in my review, I will try to not include anyin my review. 
 
Let's start with the story first, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is basically an anime about a Gravekeeper named Ai that wants to ""save"" the world when god abandoned it on sunday by travelling around the world and solving problems. 
 
The story itself isn't bad in my opinion but the only problem is that they have shown it to us in a wrong way. 
The story is basically in pieces without any or little connection between them they could release a 3/4 Episode OVA's and you could get the same results. 
It's jumping from an problem to an another problem this isn't a big issue but an problem only lasts for 3-4 episodes max which gives me unexplained parta of the story. 
 
It definitely has it up and down moments for example the Humpnie Humbert (or what his name was) arc was very good in my opinion but again with the problem described above, new introduced characters only lasts for a couple of episodes and then they have fallen into a black gap without ever reminding it anymore through the story. 
 
The Art itself was very good, It was one of the best animation that i have seen, they have mixed the colours and theme very well, This defenitily is a + Point of the whole anime. 
 
There isn't any bad points about the OST of the anime, I really liked the OP and the ED becuase they were really catchy for me atleast, i doubt they could do it any better. 
 
About the charactera again, The MC ""Ai"" has developed cery much through the anime, she started very weak in the beginning but became more brave at the end but the other characters of the anime haven't really told me anything. 
Like i said before the introduced characters only lasts for a couple of episodes (with the ezception of uri,scar and Ai) and then they are forgotten and never reminded anymore which is a - point for me. 
I do understand they are limited in episodes and want to complete it as fast as possible but this won't help anyone or me atleast. 
 
The anime overall wasn't bad with the exception of the above named points,  i do recommendes you watch this anime because i did enjoy the anime till the end but it has still left some questions in my head especially about the end which will never be explained.

    [Prelude] 
 
Despite my 6/10 rating, I DO recommend that you watch The Sunday Without God. It is a good show that very clearly tried to be great. That's all. 
 
[An Adventure] 
 
After the events of the first arc, Ai sets out on an adventure to ""save the world that God abandoned"". Unfortunately, I don't believe that Ai is an interesting enough character to lead an adventure anime. By the time that the first arc ends, we don't know anything about Ai other than that she is a gravekeeper and she is sort of a dimwit. That last trait does not bode well for a 12-year-old girl who is journeying out into a world that is said to be ""dangerous"". Due to her naivete, she is mostly led around by her supporting cast. This means that Ai is a story-driven character, which is okay until you consider that she's supposed to be pursuing a goal of saving the world. This was the show's biggest problem in my opinion. If the synopsis of the show wasn't so good, I probably would have dropped it without a second thought. 
 
[The Second Biggest Problem] 
 
As previously mentioned, the supporting cast and random events of the plot serve as the driving force for this show. It's unfortunate, then, that the character building is so rushed. Every character is plopped in the story, then within a few minutes, the audience is expected to be invested in them.  
 
This is something that I hate almost as much as the use of stupid anime tropes like guys getting caught peeping on girls and characters, in unison, saying ""ehhh?!"" as the camera pans out. Oh, yeah, and both of those happen for no reason as well.  
 
[Character Breaking- of the Show] 
 
The final issue I found in The Sunday Without God is confused tone of the show. It seemed that the director couldn't decide whether this was a philosophical mystery anime or a light-hearted adventure-comedy. Actually, this problem shows up in a lot of shows that I love. Even Re:Zero has this problem, although, in Re:Zero's case, the dark atmosphere never disappears, just recedes into the background. 
 
[Presentation] 
 
The artstyle of this show reminds me of Clannad. As is the case with Clannad, the lolis look, for lack of a better word, ""derpy"". The OP and ED are very skippable- especially the ED. I can't stand hearing Engrish. It completely takes me out of the show. 
 
[Conclusion] 
 
Despite its flaws, The Sunday Without God is a good show and I definitely recommend it. At least it *tried* to be different- unlike all of the soulless garbage being released today.

    An anime that I hesitantly ignored to watched due to my own instinct and thoughts. But ended up watching it after a psychological anime called ""Happy Sugar Life"" that left me speechless and blank. This anime literally brought me up from the pit of depression(?) to my normal mood. Honestly, I was really surprised. What really held me back from watching this anime in the past is the rating and the low review scores. I several times thought ""This anime seems cool, and it's probably good. But I think I'm over expecting it. I'm just gonna ignore it for now."". But I am wrong, this anime is a hidden gem. With a lot of potential hidden within tantamount to an unopened door with many possibilities and outcomes. After watching this anime, I did not regret trying it out in the slightest bit. But I'm guilty for not trying it out earlier than this.  
 
Story : 10/10  
 
The story is actually pretty great, and the plot is very well-made and complex. Basically, god abandoned the world, making no one able to born and die. And left one hope for humanity, which is individuals so-called ""grave keepers"". They are the ones that are able to put the dead people that are alive into peace. Ai, a young girl serves as a grave keeper for her village after her mother which was a grave keeper had passed away.  
 
One day, Ai's father ( Hampnie Hambart ) arrives at the village and kills all the villagers. Ai had nothing left for her at the village, so she decided to accompany her father on his journey. And with that, is where the adventure begins.  
 
I won't be writing any spoilers, because I think that it is best to watch this anime raw. But I'm just going to say one thing. The story is actually REALLY good. One issue is the ending which doesn't really seem to feel like an ending. Other than that, it's a masterpiece.  
 
Art : 9/10  
 
The art is brilliant, Ai is so kawaii ( don't call the cops ) and the other characters looks matches their personality. The effects are alright, and the background is okay. Nothing much to criticize nor give a good feedback about. I think putting it around 9/10 is ideal.  
 
Sound : 9/10 
 
I can't decide whether the OP and ED is good or bad. I couldn't clearly hear the opening and ending of the anime due to me watching the anime inside my dad's loud engine car. But what I know truly is the voice acting is outstanding, I nearly cried around the final episode because the voice acting, music and sound effects really matched the scene perfectly. And not just the final episode, also the majority of the scenes within this anime. They set the sounds for the moods well, and really got me into the story deeper with the outstanding sounds. Truly fascinating.  
 
Character : 10/10  
 
Don't call the cops, but I think that Ai is a waifu-loli-material. Okay, okay, jokes aside. The character developments are very good, especially for Ai. They made her story clear, I understood her past story and her past relations. Character developments for other characters are also pretty neat, but I won't say the names of the characters I want to mention because I may accidentally slip a spoiler into my review. So all I'm going to say is IT'S GOOD. 
 
Enjoyment : 9/10  
 
Besides having to watch this anime annoyingly due to my dad's loud car engine, sunlight flashing into the car and blinding me sometimes, uncomfortable, and no F water to drink throughout 7 hours. I find myself still enjoying this anime at its fullest. And I'm hoping that there will be season 2 in the future.  
 
Overall : 9/10  
 
Great anime, great story. Not gonna lie, I really wanted some more romance actions. But I guess this is fine. Yeah, I enjoyed this anime a lot. I recommend this to everyone out there. Thank you for reading. 
 
p.s. English is not my first language, thus I am not fluid in it. Please try not to feel uneasy if my writing is a little bit off. I apologize and thank you.

    Story:  
 
When someone talks to me about this series, the main part they mention is that the story is really interesting but most of the parts doesn't make sense and in my opinion i don't really see a problem with it. The episodes were usually 3-4 episodes an arc which was a good amount for them to have so we can get some character development and story in there before going to the next one. The pacing for the most part was okay and didn't feel like it was dragging on for ages. There are some parts of the series where you will either cry or feel depressed, i actually cried twice watching the series, and it just leaves with so many emotions that stay with you episode by episode. The story was really unique and was a interesting idea to cover.  
 
Art: 
 
The other thing people talk to me about that they feel hindered the anime was the artstyle. Complaining about it being to 'moe' and unoriginal, personally the artstyle dosen't bother me at all but i understand why people would not watch because of the artstyle.  
 
Sound:  
 
Sound was great and used well, the opening and ending themes to the show are amazing and i know all the words to both of them. Both just flow well with the emotions of the show.  
 
Character:  
 
The characters in the series are pretty well done, a few could have rounded off a bit more and gave us more of a backstory to give us more depth. Ai and Alice were really good characters. Characters like Scar and the girls at Gola Acadamy could have been developed a lot more than they did especially Scar. But the characters were different and most were very well developed.  
 
Enjoyment:  
 
Out of all my ratings on my lists, i mostly rate based on my enjoyment of the series. The series was well paced and every episode was different with some exciting and emotional segments which encourages me to rewatch it again and again and keep loads of enjoyment for it. I think the people who said they dont want to watch it for its moe artstyle should sit down and take in all the series has to offer. 
 
Overall:  
 
Great series, can't wait for the OVA coming 2014 and hopefully that leads on to a second season because Kami-Nai really deserves it for it's original plot and great characters.

    This will be my first anime review written, I  decided to start with this anime because I recently completed this series. We have our main character Ai, a small girl raised in a village where the whole world was abandoned by god, as the obvious title would imply, and is in search of her father as well as completing her mother's dream. 
 
Story 6/10 
 
A story with a good plot where Ai the main character decides to finish her mother's goal, but changes it midway through and decides to ""save the world"". This anime had a lot of potential, I did not read the light novel, however I felt like this anime was rushed towards the end, it had an excellent start. I was watching this and was like ""wow! this is actually really interesting"". AS the series progressed it felt as if the author was changing the plot, and Ai wasn't really making Near the end of the series I started wondering if it was going to end in the way I had thought. The ending was completely different from what I am imagined, and it had various flaws near the end of the series, you'll understand what I mean when you are watching it. The ending itself was very confusing, I may say it did suck but that's my own opinion, I was completely in shock at the ending because of the way they displayed it.  
 
Art 10/10 
 
The art is phenomenal, absolutely stunning and breath-taking. The way they display each scene, for example when Ai is considered a ""grave keeper"", a person who is capable of burying the ""dead"". In the synopsis if you've read it, it explains that since god abandoned the world, people stopped dying as well as being born, which means only a grave keeper may bury that person who is ""supposed"" to be dead. When Ai buries multiple people as the series goes on it has a absolutely beautiful glow as if there was very light almost elusive coloured lights showing that person's spirit being released. Also, near the end of the series there are two incredibly gorgeous scenes, I felt like I was totally in the scene myself.  
 
Sound 9/10 
 
The sound, just like the art is beautiful, the opening and ending themes are okay itself but when people are killed, and ""special"" things occur in the series, the sound effects are just wonderful and it really fits the mood of the scene. Each scene has a sound or music fit for the scene and it makes you feel as if you were there, the speed in which it flows the tempo matches the scene almost perfectly. 
 
Character 8/10 
 
The characters fit their personality and what they look like in my opinion. Ai, is a bit of a knuckle head, however it is because she is just so pure and innocent. Hampnie Hambert, I won't spoil who he is, but I wish there was more of him. He's what got me into the story, since he played a big part in the beginning of the story, in search of someone named Anna, and you'll see what I mean by episode 3 when I mean he plays a big part. All the characters have a significant impact in the story and they're all unique in their own way, however a few characters were not necessary, especially in the Goran Academy Arc.  
 
Overall 7/10 
 
Now, even though I gave a 9/10, a 10/10 a 8/10 and a 6/10, the reason why I gave it an overall 7/10 is because, the ending was very confusing and unless they release an OVA or something of that sort it's going to stay as a 7/10. This anime certainly had a LOT of potential, but the author just added a lot of useless and unnecessary parts especially the Goran Academy Arc, at least in my opinion. If the anime turned out to be a 25 episode, it may have have turned out to be a 9/10, but for now a 7/10 is what I'd give it. If you're looking for a decent story, beautiful art and sound, and the feeeelssss, then this anime is definitely worth watching. Just that some parts felt rushed and didn't have enough in-depth to make it a totally awesome series.

    I expected to like this show, but given how very different its arcs were, it manages to do good on some, and just outright disappoint on others. I'll try to cover most of my issues and what I liked without going too much into spoilers. 
 
The story takes place in a world where people cannot be born, nor can die. Given how unique the setting is, it's bound to be interesting, but they immediately raise a problem to it. Characters can still die, but they live on as ""undead"" until buried by gravekeepers. The issue here is there is no remarkable difference between the living and the undead, so I could not see why there was so much discrimination between them. I think the only defining factor is that the undead cannot age, but other than that, they look completely alive. The first arc does well, I liked its characters, and was shocked by a certain twist at its end. Moving on to the second one, it mainly encompasses living and undead as I mentioned before and adds silly plot points with an abruptly stupid ending which I won't go into to avoid spoilers. Third arc is basically meaningless and just as a setup to introduce the characters of the last arc. Before the last arc, we get kind of an interlude which tries to develop Scar, but they kind of just pushed her into an unnecessary situation just for development. The final arc reminded me of my favorite light novel, HakoMari, with its plot being really similar to its first volume, except handled much worse. It was going pretty well with the explanations given to the situation until the ending which tried to offer a plot twist, but that twist contradicted all prior explanations, albeit being a bit surprising, but the annoyance factor outweighs the surprise factor. Basically a story full of ups and a lot of downs, and could have been rated at least a 7 if it covered its plotholes. 
 
The art is well colored and drawn as evident in the PV and wallpaper, but the character designs seem like your generic loli girl and bishounens. It didn't really bother me but at times you can predict their personalities from their looks, which was kind of disappointing to see how they exactly follow that character trope. Sound design was nice and warm and fit the moments in the show. Hampnie was pretty much the only character I liked, I have an appeal towards Alice too but not too much, and I'm neutral toward anyone else. As I mentioned, their looks gave away their bland personalities, except for these 2 characters. 
 
Overall, I expected more from a show with blatantly obvious plotholes that ignores them so casually. Covering up these plotholes would make this show watchable, but at this rate, don't bother.

    In a world abandoned by God, where people have stopped giving birth and cannot die, there are certain humans called ""Gravekeepers"" who have the ability to bury the walking corpses that cannot die, and put them to rest. 12 year old Ai Astin is the last child born in the world and is one of those Gravekeepers. Thrust into the role at a young age when her Gravekeeper mother passed away, she has a tough task ahead of her, as she goes on a journey to save the mankind that God abandoned. ""Sunday Without God"" (Kaminai) is a 12 episode anime series done by Studio Madhouse and directed by Yuji Kumazawa.  
 
STORY: 7/10 
The story of Kaminai is split up into 5 arcs where Ai meets many new people and tries her best to help them out in any way she can. Now, Kaminai is one of the perfect examples of an anime with a high production value without a great story to back it up. The PREMISE is really good and unique in my opinion. But it just isn't handled well. I like when episodic shows split up their stories into arcs (like Mononoke) because it gives you much more time to explain and get your plot out there. But Kaminai doesn't do it well. They spend a lot of time doing nothing and then by the end the problem is usually resolved. 
 
CHARACTERS: 6/10 
Ai is pretty much the one mainstay character in the series. You've also got the recurring characters like Julie and Scar. Ai is uh....well she's not entirely useless. She is half Gravekeeper half human. And she's one of the more F**KING ADORABLE characters I've seen in recent anime. Her and her little hat and shovel :) But that's about all I have to say about her.  
 
ART: 9/10 
The animators at Madhouse are known for being damn good at their jobs. As I said before, this anime has a very high production value. The background art looks stunningly beautiful at times and I adore the character designs. If you watch this just for its amazing visuals, you will not be disappointed. 
 
SOUND: 8/10  
The music is very very soothing and just nice to listen to. The music was composed by Hiromi Mizutani who has done the music for shows like Hell Girl and Non Non Biyori. I was fine with the opening theme but THE ENDING THEME IS MAGNIFICENT. It's one of those songs that just gives me chills and brings emotion out of me. If you don't watch this anime, at least listen to this song.  
 
ENJOYMENT: 7/10 
OVERALL: 7/10 
FINAL THOUGHTS: 
Sunday Without God is a good anime. It is not bad but it's not great. I personally feel that it is unfinished and needs a 2nd season. The anime has more problems than good things about it, like it's characters, the pacing, and how the story was handled. However, if your looking for an anime with GREAT production value and a very nice soundtrack, look no further than Sunday Without God. 
But...no rush...really 
 
POSITIVES:  
-Very detailed animation by Madhouse 
-Soothing soundtrack 
-Somewhat sad and depressing arcs (if your into that) 
-Mysterious story and characters 
-Very good final arc 
 
NEGATIVES: 
-Story is not entirely well done 
-Left with too many unanswered questions 
-Characters backstories are not well explained 
-Unfinished plot 
 
See ya soon.

    Wow, where to start? Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, when it was announced that an anime adaption was being developed, I looked at the trailer, and really, I thought I wouldn't be watching this, the PV didn't speak out to me, but the topic was interesting. So when it started airing, I decided to give it a try. And boy, was I surprised. Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi offers a great story, the art is just the best I have ever seen, and the OST and music, gorgeous. 
 
By episode 3, I was completely engrossed in Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi and found myself become a complete fanatic over this series. It was amazing and breathtaking. Trust me, this anime WILL make you cry tears of sorrow and happiness. The story, I don't even know how someone could come up with this GOD-LIKE story. It is just so original and just memorizing. Also one notable thing, the ending son, ""Begun to Sing an Endless Melody,"" just plays during the ending of each episode at THE PERFECT moment, no joke, 100% spot on. Each episode was a cliffhanger, ESPECIALLY Episode 12, oh boy, could they progress into a whole season with just that, and hopefully they do! 
 
Since it is in my nature to name one bad thing about ALL animes, even this anime, which was like now tied with my number one anime, I have to write something bad to present an unbiased review. The only bad thing I would have to say about this anime is that after episode 6, or whenever the Ai and her accomplices leave Ortus, the city of the dead, the plot kind of strayed off a LITTLE bit. And by this, it kind of started getting bland, but then it quickly recovered, so DO NOT FEAR!  
 
Overall, this anime is amazing, definitely deserves another season with the cliffhanger at the end, is now tied with my number one anime of all time, will make you cry tears of sorrow and happiness, and I, DEFINITELY recommend you to freak'n watch this GOD-LIKE Masterpiece. So what are you doing reading this review, GET WATCHING! :D

    For an anime that treats the disappearance of God in the world, it certainly seems so figuratively speaking, because ""Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi"" or in its english title ""The Sunday without a God"" it looks like God decided to leave this anime to its fate after a few episodes, and it didn't develop in a satisfying manner. This is because it started with an alluring premise, yet failed miserably in its progression, deviating from its original storyline, alongside with an uninteresting heroine. 
 
~Story~ 
 
The story if the anime is centered around Ai, a 12-year-old girl who is a gravekeeper despite her young age. While it may sound simple, there is a gist to it: God left the world to its own fate, where people are neither born or die. This is the reason of the presence of these gravekeepers, the only people capable of putting people to rest by of course burying them. For little Ai this isn't something she is aware of, until a mysterious man by the name of Hampnie Hambart, who happens to have the same name as her unknown father, murders the entire village. Why did this happen?  
 
The premise of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is in fact very intriguing, presenting audiences with a topic that makes them ponder about the events to come in case the world was in fact controlled by God. The immortality of its habitants certainly questions the cons and pros of immortality, in addition to shaping the world after the disappearance of God. In most cases, these took an interesting development and certainly enhanced its premise. The anime also dedicates to introducing several elements concerning the state of affairs, which resulted in more questions. In fact, it is a world shrouded in mystery - which doesn't get revealed to the viewers in most cases. This is where the many issues with this anime begin. 
 
First of all, the fact that there are more questions than answers throughout its duration was a drawback, as these were left for the viewer to think about. This is not bad on its own, yet there were too many mysteries as well as unresolved conflicts and thematic issues to ignore these. However, the biggest gripe with the anime was its change in the direction of its story: from presenting the world, its people and its alluring theme, it steers to be a slice of life focused on its protagonist, albeit treating at times superficially its topic. This felt redundant to the story, especially considering its premise. 
 
The problem with the slice of life part, which incidentally spans the majority of the anime, is that it is as a whole uninteresting. Rather than using it for character development, it is used for the introduction of several characters and unnecessary events tied to these, such as Ai being kidnapped to go to school. In addition, besides the supernatural powers of the gravekeepers, more are introduced which felt redundant for the story as whole, being hardly ever expanded on. The abundance of plot convenient twists was also a huge drawback, especially its disappointing conclusion: it basically left viewers thinking that all the previous events were rendered useless - especially the explanation on God's disappearance. Speaking of the conclusion, it is left open. 
 
~Characters~ 
 
Moving on to the cast of characters of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, it was small as a whole, yet sufficiently large for its story. The protagonist Ai is a typical protagonist who is caring with high moral standards, yet at the same time insecure at times due to her young age and her situation. She undergoes certain character development, although not huge, tied with some fleshing out. Yet as a character she is uninteresting as she is too perfect for a 12-year-old, in addition to all the interactions with adults she encounters. Every single one of them immediately follows, praises or embraces her for no convincing reason, which is the reason she comes over as a spoiled brat. 
 
There also other characters of importance, such as Alice: he is incidentally one of the characters who contributes to the female lead. He is as a character interesting with a convincing motive, which certainly adds to the story. The problem is that his personality is generic as well his motive. Other character of importance is Dee Ensy, a fellow gravekeeper, as she gives insight onto its world, undergoing a bit of character development. 
 
Most of the other characters remain underdeveloped and unexplored, which is a shame, as some were certainly of interest. Leaving these aside, I was personally much more interested in the hardships of the people, suffering of what could be called the ""undead curse"". These were in fact portrayed in a convincing manner, yet was not really expanded on. As a whole, the characters were rather lackluster, which could be due to the fact of its time limits. 
 
~Animation and sound~ 
 
The art style of the anime was certainly a positive aspect, as these was presented with well drawn backgrounds as well as having a diverse environment. The character's design were generic, yet colourful and distinguishable. As for the animation quality, this was well done and matched with the diverse scenes the anime was portraying. 
 
The music score of the anime was befitting as whole for the anime, with some pleasant compositions, yet forgettable, which could be said about its openings and endings as well. The voice actors performed their roles well, conveying the different emotional states of the characters in a convincing manner, yet at times a bit exaggerated for my liking. 
 
~Enjoyment~ 
 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was ultimately a very lackluster anime which main culprit was its change in direction of its story, in addition to the unsatisfying open conclusion. The characters were for most part uninteresting and underdeveloped, its art style and soundtrack, as well as its premise the redeeming aspects of the anime. I honestly do not recommend this anime to anyone, unless viewers wouldn't mind the afore-mentioned issues. I am well aware that for some these wouldn't be an issue, yet personally I found it to be unacceptable as whole. 
 
Thank you for reading.

    Sunday Without God is one of those animes I watch and I am like, ""How would it be if this actually happened."" What if this world was one without death, birth or true life in general. 
 
Story 6/10 
The initial story, in a world where god abandoned it may sound really interesting but as far as the anime went it didn't feel like they really touched on the topic that much. It was more about the adventure about the young grave keeper Ai. It is as short anime so it is hard to develop a great story but ehh, it could have been expanded upon much more. 
 
Art 9/10 
It is by far one of the more artistic looking animes I have seen. Though its style does not really fit in with the tone of the anime. The anime has a morbid and touchy topic story so you would think think it would look a little darker than what it is. 
 
Sound 10/10 
I  watched this dub and may rewatch in sub but I gotta say I loved every bit of  sound and voice in this anime especially Ai, she has the most adorable voice in this series. Opening gets you pumped to watch this anime and the credits make such a good closer to any episode.  
 
Character 8/10 
Characters in this anime seem to have a straight forward personality and beliefs but I feel there is no real character development.  However thats not to say I didn't like any of them. Ai yet again takes the cake here. She is so adorable in every way. 
 
Overall 7/10 
I find Sunday Without God to be a really good anime. Its cute but yet very extreme with an usual story. I would definitely watch this anime if you enjoy stories about parallel universes from our own you should definitely watch this anime. Now if you aren't really interested after a couple of episodes I highly recommend sticking around to the end. The final few episodes are very enjoyable to watch and feel very deep. However the ending did leave me with questions on what actually happened.  It such a cliff hanger. But such good anime overall

    Starting notice: a sudden desire urged me to try a different kind of review. So the following stream of words consists of two completely separate reviews, segregated by The Wall. Read it your way and enjoy it, for this is the main reason I guided some additional trains of thought through my brain. 
 
 
""The world is no longer the same it was."" 
So, I immerged again... right into a new anime world going by the meaningful name of ""Sunday Without God"". Yes, God has literally left this world, bereaving humanity of its most essential abilities, namely giving birth and dying for good. In order to prevent the bodies of people who would actually die, but cannot anymore, from rotting away, the so called gravekeepers are capable to grant them their final rest.  
And one of these gravekeepers is Ai, a 12-year-old, slightly spoiled girl who doesn't know anything of the world outside her calm home village. But suddenly, by some unfortunate coincidences, she is forced to leave her self-built cage of quietness and has to enter a world unbeknownst to her.  
 
Getting in contact with other peculiar characters trying to come through life without a god, not much time flows by before she has to deal with important questions like: How can this world be saved from its fate? Is dying actually that bad after we know it has been taken from us? What does it really mean, being a gravekeeper? Or how can I let my comrades remember the positive side of life? 
The last point mentioned leads me to Ai's personality. Somehow she reminds me of Taiga from Toradora with her looks, and so I initially thought of a more tsunderish behaviour to be seen. Nope, Ai starts pretty girlish, a bit impulsive, but stays calm enough, and the life in the village made her naive against more complex things. And then, as the anime advances, especially since it is only 12 episodes long, I really have to compliment how firm and diversified she becomes towards the end. I don't use this word often, but I have to admit that, all in all, Ai is just cute in both her appearance and her behaviour.  
The other characters are all likeable enough. They don't experience the same kind of development as Ai, but have their stories to tell and sometimes mentionable traits to reveal. You certainly won't get bored by them. 
 
A last mention on the main story. It doesn't meet a final or conclusive end, so maybe you will be a bit displeased. But you know, there is always the possibility to read the novel, which I actually haven't read, but certainly it contains satisfying answers to your remaining questions. 
 
Art- and soundwise actually only one word is needed: Enchanting. 
To give some more annotations for the detail-loving ones: Since quite a few scenes happen during dawn or dusk, oftentimes this 'yellow' prevailing mood is conveyed. And this is accompanied by astoundingly stunning light and shadow effects. The enchanting soundtrack gets noticed and varies to suit the special mood without a God. Animation is fluid and has some awesome 3D-rides in store, showing up even in the opening. Now that I mention it, both opening and ending are beautiful and nearly melancholic for me now. They won't get boring too soon like so many other ones.  
 
""Each of us sees a different world."" 
So, these words are optimal to impart my final thoughts. This series turned out as an unexpected fabulous tale, and so, in case you relish anime with an enchanting atmosphere, an adorable girl as lead character and themes like dealing with the dead, then for God's sake, watch it. And even if you see the world in a different way than me, you still have to assert that this show is a million times better than the crap today's television mainly provides. Deem these 12 episodes as a present to fulfil your life.

Another day without the God... 
Why did he leave a world so torn? 
The dead walk on, are left to rot 
and human life cannot be born. 
 
So gravekeepers are bound to give 
the walking dead a gentle fall. 
We follow Ai who strives to live, 
to save the world, to save them all. 
 
Beginning as a naive child 
who doesn't know the world outside. 
Develops firm and inner wild 
and lets the better thoughts abide. 
 
Discovering peculiar guys, 
the dead's country or even school, 
receiving words pensive and wise, 
she slowly learns the keepers' rule. 
 
In colours mystical and bright 
the world illuminates its thoughts. 
With stunning shadow-use and light 
the people rise above their hearts. 
 
The music part is not just bound 
to great open and ending themes. 
Since life and death itself far sound, 
the world is tangible, it seems. 
 
Although the story doesn't meet 
high standards or a final end. 
Enjoyment smoothly plants its seed, 
and I stayed with it where it went. 
 
So when the tension falls and grows, 
you have to feel and to endure. 
Beside some mainstream actions shows 
this is a jewel, that's for sure!

    Story: 
Overall Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (Sunday Without God) has a very premise. What if god left and people can no longer give birth and, while they can still be 'dead', can no longer be at rest without the help of a 'Gravekeeper', special individuals who have the ability to make the dead move on. And as a show involved with helping various character find peace in order to move on, it can get very emotional. 
The pacing for the most part is very good, following 4 mostly self contained arcs over the course of 3 episodes. The arcs are mostly character driven, delving into aspects of how society would react to this change in the world. 
Some parts of the story however can feel rushed and skimmed over and while the ending was very enjoyable and satisfying, it does leave a lot of the world unexplored and questions unanswered. Episodes 7-9 felt particularly weak in comparison to the rest of the series to me. However the other three arcs were really strong. 
If I had to explain it in one sentence I would say that it's like a cross between the best parts of Angel Beats and Torchwood: Miracle Day. 
 
Art: 
The art is lovely and consistent throughout. There are certain moments (and hopefully without spoiling too much) that happen when the 'dead' are put to rest which are wonderfully beautiful and very much enjoyable. 
 
Sound: 
For me, nothing really stood out too much. However that was partly due to the music matching the gentle and relaxing tone of the anime. It didn't need to stand out and it did its job. It just wasn't memorable. The opening however was very much enjoyable. 
 
Character: 
This is where the show stands out. Being a mainly character driven show it's understandable that most of the effort is expended in making the characters three dimensional in order for the emotional conflict to affect the audience. 
The majority of the characters only remain for their three episode arc in which time we meet them, learn more about them, and grow to care for them. This is especially prominent in last arc. (I may have cried.) 
There are some flaws. Various characters (especially in the 3rd arc) are barely touched on or not touched on at all. And for me a certain character went through a change that seemed to happen too suddenly and with very little explanation. I feel like it could have been handled a lot better. But I understand that 12 episodes isn't much time to fit a lot into. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I really enjoyed this. It was sweet and touching and made me cry. There were certain parts that I felt took too long or were glossed over but aside from that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was just a really nice series to experience. 
 
Overall: 
It's good. It's got relly well done emotional scenes at times but at others there are issues glossed over that I felt could have had more attention paid to them. At 12 episodes long it's definitely worth watching.

    A world in which nobody can be born, but nobody dies either. The only way somebody can truly die is by being buried by a Gravekeeper. All of this because God had abandoned the world on a Sunday.  
An interesting concept, is what I thought to myself when I read about Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (or simply ""Sunday Without God"") and I decided to watch it and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. As always, let's start off with the story. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The story of Sunday Without God both starts and ends interestingly (I won't be spoiling anything). The story opens up with a twelve year old Gravekeeper by the name of Ai, who takes over as the town's gravekeeper after her mother dies. Then two mysterious men show up and Ai gets caught up in a series of events, but she has a motive of her own: to save the world. As much as I loved this anime, the story starts off strong, but gets a bit weaker . I won't say why, you'll have to see for yourself. I'm not saying the ending was bad! But I won't say if it was good either to avoid spoiling. Despite this, I give the story a 7/10 
 
Art: 10/10 
This being a very recent anime, it has impeccable artwork done on it. Art is always important to me when I watch anime, and Sunday Without God did not disappoint. The second I laid eyes on it, I was simply amazed by how beautiful it went, and how well the art complemented the story. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
No problem with the sound. It was brilliant. Not much to say. 
 
Character: 9/10 
There is no doubt in my mind that Sunday Without God has characters in it that you grow attached to. There are characters in this anime that you will love, and perhaps for no reason at all. Many characters I found myself loving the second I laid eyes on them. There are no characters that just act so antagonistic that you can't help but hate them; every character is loveable in some way or another. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
Often I find myself zoning out when I watch anime. However this isn't an issue when it comes to watching Sunday Without God. From the very get-go I couldn't get myself to stop paying attention. Yeah, sure, this anime doesn't have a plot that goes throughout the entire twelve episodes, but it has several smaller ones, each more interesting than the last. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
I give this anime an overall rating of 7. Why 7 and not 9 or 10 after I spoke so highly of it? Well, this anime surely has its positives: Outstanding artwork, amazing characters and a very interesting idea for the overall story. However, I have to mark it down as I was expecting it to stick more to the idea of people not being born anymore, and people dying but not actually dying until being buried by a Gravekeeper. At times it seems like they threw the idea out the window. They didn't, of course. It just didn't seem very important at times. I know you can't have the same bland crap being thrown at you every minute of every episode, but I don't feel as though there was enough of it in there. 
 
My final verdict is: give this anime a try! Hopefully you will love it like I did.

    You'll be forgiven for thinking Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi just glorified loli show with superficial theological issues thrown in just to seem deep and intellectual. That's certainly the attitude I went into this anime with; but what I discovered behind its veneer of gaudiness was a genuinely decent plot taking viewers through well thought-out settings populated by characters who, barring the odd few, all had a clear purpose in the story. So before you turn down this anime upon seeing its seemingly pretentious opening, read on; and afterwards, go and finish the first few episodes before deciding whether or not to drop it. 
 
First things first. Kami-inai is adapted from a series of light novels, all of which are practically self contained stories revolving around the protagonist, Ai, and the various people she meets along her journey through the world. And as a result, the anime follows an arc structure, with the characters, settings, and events of each arc barely ever appearing again beyond their few episodes. This brings us to deceptive point number one: Ai is the only main character; everyone else, even if they are listed as such, is a supporting character who will not appear again once their arc has concluded. 
 
While the arcs are self contained, they all take place in this world which has supposedly been forsaken by God; and here's deceptive point number two. Kami-inai is very, very light on actual theological substance. The focus of its title, and arguably the main draw of the show for newcomers, is really nothing more than a plot device to allow for the plots of each individual arc. But that's not to say that this makes the show bad. Rather, it allows Kami-inai to explore a range of themes across its widely diverse and compelling settings, even if they're not particularly innovative. In fact, it's the settings of Kami-inai that are its true strength, more than making up for the disappointment of the title being mere bait. Of the show's four arcs, two take place in settings tied closely to the arc's theme; and of course, they're both evocative and entirely unpredictable, the latter due on no small part to the arc structure of the series. So at the very least, you'll be kept entertained by the fresh content that comes by every few episodes. 
 
Another place where Kami-inai really excels is in emotional impact. Again, because each arc is a self contained story, they all end with very emotional scenes; and given how difficult it is to write a good emotional scene, Kami-inai has me more than a little impressed. This is no Clannad, but that doesn’t stop it from being good nonetheless. However, as is the case with all good emotional scenes, there’s always quite a bit of plot beforehand that’s needed to build up all the impact later on, and here’s where viewers might get turned off the show. The plot sections, for the most part, do a brilliant job of exploring the arc’s setting with an appropriate air of mystery; but when it’s not doing that, the viewers are left seeing the characters interact with one another as they do what they have to do. And this usually means seeing Ai being what she is: a loli. I personally have nothing against these segments, but there are those who find Ai annoying as a character and the things she does ridiculous; and certainly there is merit to that view. Not only that, but the show shifts from serious to comedic in tone to accompany Ai’s loli acts, and sometimes the change is so jarring it’s simply not welcome. But since Kami-inai always remedies these annoyances with the emotional parts that follow afterward, they’re not really that much of a problem. 
 
For all the good that Kami-inai does with its emotional scenes, the said scenes are unfortunately also used at times to cover up gaping plot holes at the end of each arc. Or maybe it’d be better to say that gaping plot holes exist where the writers decided to kick reason to the curb in favour of writing scenes that would make viewers cry, for maximum audience appeal; and of course, this has the neat upshot of making said viewers less likely to notice the plot holes. If you’re the sort of person who can’t stand a shoddily-made plot then you won’t like it when it happens; but thankfully, there is only one real plot hole in the series. So it’s not so bad. 
 
I realise I’ve been praising the arc structure quite a bit in this review. Once you get over the idea that there is no single plot connecting the stories, Kami-inai’s structure actually makes for a pretty good meta-plot, because each arc is as a consequence sharply focused, with zero filler. But that’s within the arcs. So it kind of sucks when the third arc, episodes 7 and 8, is total filler; and what makes it even worse is that characters who are carried over to the next arc are developed here, so you can’t just skip it and move on. You can’t just blame Madhouse for it either – believe me, I wanted to – because they were just faithfully adapting volume 3 of the light novel series.  They actually cut it shorter than a standard three-episode arc; but even so, those two episodes alone take Kami-inai and drag it down from something amazing into something merely great. 
 
Now enough of the plot. Kami-inai is a beautifully drawn and animated series; my only complaint is the slight overuse of CGI in the early few episodes, not because they look bad but simply because they don’t fit in with the rest of the animation. But CGI usage peters out beyond those two or three episodes, so it’s not really a problem. The art is bright and colourful, with a slight fantastical tint that sets the world apart from the normal world (or what passes for it in anime); and while the art style sometimes has the characters looking a little flat when viewed front-on, they’re still very detailed and very well drawn. Light and shadow is also used very well, often to great dramatic effect. Simply put, Kami-inai is beautiful. 
 
And it’s not just easy on the eyes, too. The music is awesome, creating with ease the spooky, mysterious, and heartrendingly beautiful atmospheres that pervade the show. A lot of the emotional impact (and not just the crying scenes) is built on the background music, which should give you an idea of how good they are. Acting, for Ai and her main supporting cast, is consistently good, and all the characters come off as real and believable. And of course, mention must be made to the OP and ED songs, respectively ‘Birth’, sung by Kitamura Eri, and ‘Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita.’, sung by Komatsu Mikako (yes, I’m writing the names inverted by English rules. Deal with it). The OP song is catchy and fun song to listen to, if standard JPop fare; but the ED’s is downright amazing. By itself it contributes to a great deal of the emotional impact I mentioned earlier; and even better, Madhouse plays with its ED so that the song will start before the credits roll, and sometimes the whole ED is cut in favour of just letting the credits and song play across what’s going on – and the emotional impact of those moments is then magnified, pardon my exaggeration, a few hundredfold. It should say a great deal that while I really looked forward to the start of the episode when it aired every Sunday, I looked forward to the end even more. 
 
So there you have it. If you want good plot Kami-inai’s got it. If you want good setting Kami-inai’s got it, and by the bucketloads. If you want themes Kami-inai’s got it. If you want good characters Kami-inai’s aren’t half bad. And if you want good music Kami-inai’s is damn amazing. So if you’ve haven’t watched this series before or quit at the start because of how stupid it seemed, keep watching and get past the show’s deceptive shallowness to reach the wealth of greatness it has to offer. It’s well worth it.

    Usually I dont judge a story only for their ending but for the whole story. For the whole story...I'd give it a 5 (for reasons you can find here a bit later). But...this ending totally crossed the line for me and I can't be honest with myself if for once I don't give an Anime's overal rating based on the ending... A 1. 
 
 
First the good sides, WATCH IF what you care about is : 
 
-pretty art 
-pretty soundtrack 
 
 
DON'T WATCH IF : 
 
-you use your head when watching Animes 
-dislike plot holes 
-dislike rushed stories 
-dislike incoherent characters 
-dislike the Deus Ex Machina  
 
 
(Deus Ex Machina has the negative connotation of an utterly improbable, illogical or baseless plot twist that drastically alters the situation) 
 
 
Because that's the main problem with this Anime... The story has a very good potential, I won't deny that (and that's why I'd give it an overall 5 if it wasn't for the ending, but I'll explain later), but....it was rushed. Every arc lasts around 3 episodes. Every arc feels rushed and forced. Now, it is a 12 long episodes Animes, so they decided to cover as much as possible (I assume it's based on a novel or a manga). However....to me it's a bad decision. They should have developped the first or the last arc properly or choose two arcs instead. 
 
(I cannot write spoilers so I won't be able to give you examples) 
 
Rushed, plot holes, characters' being incoherent and incoherences with the fiction's rules itself. I could excuse that considering they have very little time and made the mistake to want to cover as much as possible, but...as I said above...the ending was too much for me to bare. 
 
If during the rest of the Anime there was simple incoherences or plot holes, in the ending, not only do you have a complete denial of the fiction's rules but you have two Deus Ex Machina in a single episode... The last one of course... And it is literally rubbed in your face before getting hidden by a supposdly sad scene that should make you forget about the fact what just happened is simply making nonesense not only with the situation it should solve, but also with the fiction's rules (here the role of the gravekeeper is put the dead to rest...and that's it...and what happens in the last episode ? something that was depicted as impossible for gravekeepers; that's just one of the two Deus Ex Machina). 
 
All in all, you better turn off your brain while watching this, make so as if you don't understand what's going on and just appreiciate the art and soundtrack.

    What's the worst medium to adapt into anime? There are, of course, good, average and bad examples of every form of adaptation, but it seems to me (and you may or may not agree with me) that for the most part, light novel adaptations are the ones that seem to fail most often. I'm talking stuff like To Aru Majutsu no Index, Date A Live, Sword Art Online and, most recently, the subject of this review, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. Let me just state that this rule is not, of course, universal. Simply general. 
 
Why is this? Why do LN adaptations seem to struggle? My suspicion rests on the structure of the source material: the one-book, one-subplot, one-climax system that works well for a series of small novels. However, in the case of anime adaptations, a strict adherence to the source material renders the format of the show predictable and, particularly in the case of shorter series with less time to explore the available material, the story arcs rushed and contrived. Without some alteration to the pacing and structure of the story (see Durarara), light novel adaptations will forever fail to achieve greatness. 
 
So what of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, the anime that I've already spent 2 paragraphs not reviewing yet? Well, I'm afraid to say that despite some nice ideas, impressive atmosphere and brilliant production standards, this series is arguably one of the LN Adaptations greatest casualties. Now I've not read the source material, but I suspect that it handles the story much more effectively. That's because in the course of 12 episodes, Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi somehow manages to rush through 5 arcs with a lot of implied complexity, while simultaneously failing to establish any kind of direction, interconnectivity or explanation. The result is a story that entirely fails to satisfy, particularly when you consider that a couple of the arcs (the first in particular) could last 12 episodes by themselves with enough thought. But no, we get 5 poorly explained, rushed and entirely inconsequential arcs when one well-developed arc with sufficient complexity would've suited the show better. 
 
Not that KnIN (abbreviated name ftw) is entirely without the foundations of a good series. In fact, the show has so many good ideas that it simply serves to make it more disappointing that they are handled so poorly. We've got characters that are engaging (with the exception of the lead, whose character development begins and ends with ""cute loli""), but for the most part they are underused and completely unconnected to whatever central story arc that this show was trying to create. There's a total lack of significance placed on some interesting character conflicts. Likewise, the story has some fantastic fantasy elements focusing on a potentially complex and well-conceived world, but these devices and ideas are never fully explored. Witches? Immortal killers? Cities of the dead? Time loops? Great ideas, but hideously flawed in their execution. I understand that the show is taking the Angel Beats approach of remaining ambiguous with regard to its metaphysical elements, but there's an art to that, in that you actually have to explore elements that you're remaining ambiguous about that provides enough info for us to construct some theories, and KnIN doesn't. 
 
OK, the show has some effective emotive scenes: 2 to be precise, and the Julie/Scar romance subplot could've carried a show by itself instead of being sidelined like it was. But in the case of the 2 high-impact emotional scenes, the ""feelz"" are pretty cheap and dependant on the mood established by the technical elements, rather than any strong relation or connection with events. In fact, in the case of the first example, we don't even get time to feel any kind of emotional connection because the arc is so rushed. Characters established, relationship suddenly present and then climax. No time to build any real empathetic response. And in the second example, the events over which we cry are instantly reversed. Y'know, the old Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, Kanon 2006 ""you-thought-they-were-dead-and-cried-over-it-but-they-aren't-really"" trick. 
 
I believe I just mentioned the technical aspects of the series, and I guess it's safe to say that they are incredibly well produced, but at the same time we've come to expect that from recent releases to the point where high-quality animation is pretty much par-for-the-course. This isn't the early-2000s any more; basically every show gets good animation nowadays. Animation's smooth, character models are consistent and designs are nice to look at. The ""lighting"" effects are probably the highlight of KnIN's aesthetic, as they do manage to lend a relatively awe-inspiring warmth to a fantastic world. The sound is also very effective in establishing the mood, whether the scene be sad, happy or mystical in nature. Some very nice tracks playing the background, and a fairly good (but not fantastic) OP/ED sequence set. 
 
So what do I have to say in conclusion? Put simply, KnIN is a beautifully-conceived disappointment. It's a show with so many nice ideas, but it's been rung out and compacted so much that it feels a bit too dry. Mediocre, cheap emotion rather than any kind of relateable character conflicts, with the more interesting supporting cast ultimately being sidelined to a static little girl. It never goes anywhere, never does anything and never seems to make a point, and far from being the profound masterpiece that it thinks it is, it's simply pretentious. Yeah, that's the right word.

    First off, I'm not here to write some 3 chapter review, these are my quick thoughts on how I think this series played out, enjoy. 
 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, an anime I was quite looking forward to this season, but like many others, it has let me down. 
 
Now in saying this I can't say it's all bad. This series has some of the best art and sound that I have seen, the characters are all extremely well designed, beautiful background and scenery and everything blends very well. 
 
But that's where it stops for me.  
 
Series like this just try to jam too much into there short time frame. Our heroine, Ai, had plenty of character development, but there is only minor character development for the rest of our cast, which we are introduced to 20+ over these 12 episodes. 
 
As far as story goes, I didn't enjoy it. Ai has this big dream to save the world, but instead gets stuck on all these side quests and her dream is pretty much put completely on hold. She is questioning her own dream towards the end, but we never get an answer. She makes the big call of finishing her side quest but we never find out if she will ever do what she set out to do, or any form of conclusion to her own goal. 
 
All in all the art and sound alone were enough to get this up to a 5 from me, that alone made this quite amazing to watch. Unfortunately most of the characters are forgettable and the story gets lost. Worth a watch but nothing special!

    In the world we live in today, religion is a very big thing. It shapes the minds and the ideals of most, if not all, of the beings on Earth, whether they realize it or not. It's been claimed that the American founding laws were based upon Christian ideals and still plays a key part in the society that America believes in. So when God suddenly abandons the world and leaves the inhabitants of Earth to fend for themselves for all eternity, it's safe to say that chaos would ensue. This is the case that Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi presents to us, and expects us to fill in the pieces in between as the story begins twelve years after God's retreat. 
 
The story begins with a girl named Ai. She is the central character within this entire series. She receives the most screentime out of any other character and the plot comfortably revolves around her innocent sense of justice. She lives in a small town comprised of people whom she's been around her entire life. Unaware to her knowledge, however, is the fact that everyone around her is already dead, and it is her responsibility to give them all a proper death by burying them. Why does the responsibility rely on her? Because she is a graveskeeper: a being created (somehow) after God's disappearance with the purpose of burying the immortal dead in order to legitimately put them to death. But the surprises don't end there. In comes a mysterious man who runs rampant, ""killing"" every member of Ai's town in a blind rampage of bloodshed and dismemberment. Why is this man killing everyone? And why now? This is one of many struggles that Ai has to deal with in this series. 
 
What Kamisama tries to do quickly and early is establish character depth. To give reason behind the characters' actions and why they choose to believe that reasoning. This occurs with almost every character that appears at some point throughout the series. What Kamisama does differently from others, however, is discard the characters as soon as it feels that the character has been properly developed. While this isn't necessarily a problem, Kamisama is faced with an age-old problem that many other anime have dealt with in the past: time. As you will probably recall as you read this, Kamisama is only a one-cour series. In the course of the series, an estimated fifteen to twenty characters come and go throughout the twelve episodes in this series. How many of these characters are given attempted development? Nearly all of them, in a twelve episode series. How the series believes it can give a proper amount of character development to so many new characters episode after episode is bizarre, to say the least. And when a series doesn't give a character enough development, that character becomes both unlikable and forgettable. This is the case for almost all characters in the series as along with the innumerable amount of characters, the series also gives off an uneven distribution of character attention. Ai gets more screentime than any other character in the series, and it shows, as she's the most identifiable character in the entire series. But whether this makes her realistic is a different story altogether. 
 
With any series that involves a deity of any sort, Kamisama has its share of inconsistencies with miraculous events. Within the series, it is evident that even without a God in place, unrealistic events continue to happen. Perhaps this is due to God controlling the flow of logic within the world, but that, sadly, is never explored. And among these unrealistic feats is another age-old cliche that many other past anime have experimented with: wishing. If one wishes for something ""hard enough,"" their wish has a good chance of coming true. Kamisama uses this as plot convenience for the most part, while at other points it becomes the center of the plot itself. What it doesn't do is explain itself. If God does not exist, how can people grant wishes? Who controls the wishes? The only being capable of doing so would be God itself, but It had abandoned the world as previously stated, so what becomes of this? This also ties in with my theory that God controls the logic within the world, but is never developed any further. Inconsistencies also occur as the characters begin to receive any sort of development. A certain trend that this series likes to take is to have the central character, Ai, give a new, innocent perspective to the horrid, cruel world around her to the characters involved in internal conflict. They take the words of a twelve year-old to heart and convert their ideals to match the more optimistic ideals that she comes up with. Perhaps the series is trying to convey a moral of looking at pessimism with optimism. To take a world without God and view it as a world of extra opportunities at living life. If it means wishing for anything you want, that world is soon to be corrupted regardless. 
 
As stated above, there are many characters that appear throughout this series, while only a few stay around for the entire series. These rare characters include Ai, Yuri, and Scar. Ai, again, is the central character, and the entire plot revolves around her and her carefree look on life and impenetrable sense of justice. Her development as a character is the most solid of any other character in the series and she becomes the driving force behind most of the resolutions to conflicts that arise within Kamisama. While her development is compact, her likability is a bit shaky. She's likable to the point that she's a cute, innocent child, but that's really all there is to her. She has her own idea of ""profound beliefs,"" but they're hard to take seriously from a child who has been isolated from the outside world her entire life. Combine that with a personality with no visible flaws and you have the reincarnation of God itself. Yuri is a character who is introduced with a dark background. His family had died since God's disappearance and had been wandering around alone before meeting Ai and Scar. He receives some necessary screentime upon his introduction, but the attention on him declines as the series continues. His role eventually becomes ""The Father"" of the group, which only leaves him enough screentime to remind the viewer that he exists. Scar is a graveskeeper like Ai, but unlike Ai, is devoid of any extraordinary personality. She's calm and collected all the time. Her role in the series is very similar to Yuri's as she becomes more of ""The Mother"" to Ai as the series continues. As is typical, her character is quickly discarded in order to better develop Ai's character. All other characters who's names I will not mention for convenience sake are either given very little development or are only relevant for a few episodes. Another example of how the series likes to play favorites. 
 
One of the things that initially brought my attention to Kamisama was the creamy colors. By that, I mean when the colors of a bold source of light blends in with the characters' expressions or movements that cause them to have unrealistic or bolder facial expressions and shadow features. This type of animation isn't seen much in this current generation and could be considered somewhat avant-garde to new fans of animation. One thing Kamisama does right is make the characters look pretty. The eyes are bold and flashy, and the character design is unlike many seen in any recent anime series. In terms of character animation, I have no complaints. The characters looked okay and they moved okay, despite a certain character's hair color blending into the vivid view of the sunset. 
 
It's easy to believe that a fantasy anime would use fantasy elements to help progress a plot in the right direction. What makes this controversial, however, is the decision and logic behind it. What makes the disappearance of God so impactful in Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi? After a few episodes, viewers tend to forget that the world is without God, as the series makes little mention of it whenever something goes haywire. The biggest factor in determining the validity of this series is its loyalty to its original purpose: to provide a world that is ruined without God and how the outlook of a single girl can change the views of the people she meets with a single outburst. What makes this world ruined by God's abandonment of the Earth? The viewer is left unsure. The idea that one should look at pessimism with optimism is again apparent with this, but is the world truly pessimistic? Having your wishes granted and being immortal could be a true paradise to some, if not many across the world. What God has accomplished by abandoning the world is never revealed, nor does it provide any sort of clue as to how it accomplishes anything. The only conclusion I can come to after watching this series is that the world can survive without God. All it needs is a mascot to cheer up the denizens among it. In this case, it's a little girl named Ai. May the world rest in peace.

    After reading the latest Kami-no-inai light novel and following the latest anime episodes (no manga read unfortunately), I've got only one thing to say about this. 
 
Magnifique! 
 
Gorgeous artwork done in all of the medias of this series, a very different storyline than your average booksale, characters that you would always remember. And god the music, wonderful effects alongside the animation effort done. 
 
Oh wait, God should be gone in this anime (haha). 
 
As somebody very kindly told me about it, I will edit the review and add this 
 
SPOILERS AHEAD, TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING SPOIL! 
 
for the first chapter of the anime.  
 
(It is awfully hard not to spoil absolutely anything in a review, how could I explain anything without a tiny little bit of plot? OTL) 
 
Story 9/10 
 
As there cannot be any spoilers, and obviously light novel is far ahead of the anime plot, so this is my opinion based on light novel and anime adaption. 
 
The light novel compared to animation, is written in more details, describing the adventure of the main heroine, Ai in a mission most people deemed impossible. The story structure (the world) is very different to how a normal reader would find, and in many cases in both anime and novel,  you would have to put yourself into the characters, and blend the world's ideals into your own in order to fully understand.  
 
As you continue watching, there might be some confusing ideas, and small loopholes that could be neglected. This is the result of cropping the massive storyline of the original plot to fit into the 13 episodes series, and it might result in some unanswered questions. But they also cropped out some of the repeated and long plotlines in the novel, which might bore the readers, and there would be an urge in our minds, wanting the story to progress faster. (especially the Ortus arc, towards the end I just felt a massive drag in plotlines) 
 
Art 10/10 
 
Best thing in the anime and the first reason when I bought the first novel from the online store, the gorgeous gorgeous illustration of Ai in the front cover of the book. And I could say the same with the anime, the first episode is absolutely beautiful, and it quickly took me in. The golden mists flying randomly in the atmosphere, the evening skies illuminating a quiet and simple countryside, and the characters populating the area. The artwork is that amazing, that I was slightly surprised when I found out the villagers are not as normal as you think, even though I had read the first book 2 years ago. 
 
The artwork also delicately described every possible detail of the characters beautifully, following the novels, so the readers would not feel a massive differences between the animation and manga/novel. And the eyes, the EYES! They definitely drew me in, mesmerizing me and if technology allows, I would slowly walk into the screen and fall into the world.  
 
Way too exaggerating on that part, but thats the magic of the artwork. 
 
Sound 9/10 
 
Music, soundtrack, although it is not as strongly described as the artwork, but it also mixed into the story very well. Although there isn't a miracle magic happening when the music and the plotline comes in the right moment, but it helps fill in emotions and feelings that couldn't be easily discovered through the anime. And to be honest, an anime with bad or no soundtrack (background music) behind is definitely not an appealing anime to watch. 
 
Seiyuu-sans did very well in giving life to the characters, Aki Toyosaki did a great job in voicing Ai, the always growing and learning Ai (although there are still some naivety left in her heart as she is only 12!). But the best seiyuu in the anime in my opinion is definitely Daisuke Namikawa, who voiced Hampnie Hambart, the cold-blooded corpse killer and the first mentor and savior of Ai. When his voice rang up, I shivered slightly from that metallic voice-over, and the two conflicting ideals of the character's mind are shown, with a slight warm feeling in the cold hard demeanor. 
 
Music is the biggest factor in pulling the scores up to a 9, the Opening and Ending of the anime is absolutely marvellous, building up such a tension enough that I looped both songs three times before watching each episodes. 
 
Character 8/10 
 
Characters! Totally loved them! 
 
The authors have amazingly created these characters that are perfectly suitable in the twisted world structure. Ai, the main heroine, is one of the miracle child in the world. Living in a protective dome, surrounded by adults that pampered her greatly, and so she is ignorant of the perils and chaos in the world. But she is also an analyst and a very observant character, and with her limited knowledge of the world she managed to understand by herself (although most people would still deem it naive or mad).  
 
Hampnie Hambart is also a great character, in the first few episodes you might think he is a skilled assassin who kills without remorse, but in truth he isn't trained at all, with only the ability of immortality to protect him. The two radically different viewpoints of the character is what makes it a very memorable character in the anime. Sadly he is a side character and we wouldn't be able to see more of him (Really expecting a side story depicting of Hambart's past!) 
 
Wanted to score it higher but I reserved a few points for future episodes to see the full cast. 
 
Overall 8/10 
 
I scored it 8 in the same reason as the character. 
 
I really loved this series and I am absolutely thrilled to see it on animation. And I definitely wanted it to continue past the absolute barrier of 13 episodes.  
 
-EDITED PART AFTER THE 12 EPISODES- 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
 
I have scored it 8, bit lower as I have expected. I did not enjoy it as greatly as hoped, and the reading of light novel might have wrecked it. As the light novel is written in much detail, I have hoped the anime staff would choose some favourite parts to re-animate from the books (I have to find all the illustrations arts for the novel as I have lost them :( ) And in the end they have whitewashed the series and made it quite bland in my taste, losing some of the best climax scenes in the novel and left a sour note at the ending. I was totally shocked when the anime staff took away the entire TOWER chapter, its reasonable as it is one of the longest after the Dead City, but it is just pure horrible to see it not even appearing as there are some very interesting philosophies of life and the struggle of mankind, and I recommend any new or fans who have read and enjoyed my review to read the chapter; confusing, but also very interesting. 
 
Even though it is not as perfectly ended as I had hoped, but with the mild and warm artwork and music complimenting the anime as it goes, it will still draws me to watch it. (Although not as much re-watch value as the light novel). 
 
And to finish up for the edited part, I would recommend every single one of kami-inai fans to read the light novel, at least after dead city (as it is the part where Alis began his entry, and where the story starts to strip away).

    There are seven days for a weekend. There's Monday through Friday where people work fruitlessly to create a better world. There's Saturday where people gets a chance to enjoy the world where we live in. Then, there's Sunday where there's a chance to relax as the cycle begins all over again. Well if there's God exists, we know that he created a world for us to enjoy. But on Sunday, he decides to take a vacation. Sounds like fun right? Well, maybe for him but definitely not for us.  
 
Welcome to Sunday Without God, a world where God decides to forsaken the world.  
 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (also known as Sunday Without God) is a series adapted from the light novel of the same name written by Kimihito Irie and illustrated by Shino. The series tells the story of a young girl named Ai living in a world without God. Apparently, God has abandoned this world fifteen years ago and now, new humans are no longer born and the dead can no longer die. Luckily, there are beings known as gravekeepers that can maintain balance and bring peace to those who are deceased. It's not exactly a pretty story to imagine especially since Ai has taken the responsibility to prepare graves for a village where its people will eventually die. Do you fear death? I'm sure most people do but in this series, it takes on a whole new twist at that concept. 
 
For starters, the series takes on a fantasy theme with its setting. In fact, it's clear that the world Ai resides in is not something you'd witness in everyday life. Rather than being realistic, this show relates to the concept of death in a more imaginative way.  
 
Ai is an interesting character to take notice of in this show. She is only 12 years old but bears a huge responsibility as a gravekeeper. We can also tell that she had a strong bond with her mother based on various flashbacks that are played throughout the series. But because of her young age, Ai is one of those characters that are a bit naive with how the world functions. Even more complicated though is the state of the current world that she resides in without a God. As this becomes a source of mystery, there are many questions that viewers may be interested in from the start. For Ai though, she has some questions of her own regarding her father and why the world she resides is at this state.  
 
As if mysteries weren't enough, we also get to meet a young man named Hampnie Hambart from the beginning. There are even more mysteries regarding this man as Ai is convinced that he might be her father. There's little resemblance (at least physically) between Hambart or Ai. In fact, Ai looks much closer to her mother as opposed to this man. And if that wasn't enough, Hambart's violent debut makes Ai feel a bit intimated with his morals. There is a certain calculating factor about Hambart throughout the show that makes him an interesting character as well. In fact, one might interpret Hambert as more of an anti-hero. One could relate to the fact that he “kills” people in order to lay them to peace with his gun. At the same time, it's clear that he wishes to just put them to peace at last rather than letting them bear their existence in a world without God. More importantly later on though, we learn a shocking revelation about him and his fate might also come as a big surprise.  
 
The series focuses on Ai's development but at the same time, we also get to meet others such as Scar, Ulla, Alis, Dee, and among others of interest. All of these characters possesses their own ideologies and their view of the current conditions in a world without God. Of these characters, Alis is a one of the more noticeable ones with a similar resemblance to Hambert. More importantly though, he has the same motivation as Ai in order to save the world but takes on a very different perspective in doing so. Talk about being on a totally opposite scale. Furthermore, most of the characters in this show has their own supernatural abilities of which we get to witness later on. In such a fantasy world, it should be expected.  
 
The series focuses its main premise quite a bit but also takes approaches at settling off other directions with its various arc-like format. The beginning part clearly goes straight into the point, second half goes on a more in depth exploration of Ai's character as she meets others while the third focuses on other settings of their world as well as the other characters. Nevertheless, the plot becomes somewhat loose at various occasions as well as feeling in being dragged out. However, you will expect the unexpected earlier on. Tthe series balances between its serious atmosphere along with comedy at many occasions. Various flashbacks played throughout the show also seems to draw a sense of nostalgia for Ai. She is only twelfth years old and already witnessed things that a girl of her age shouldn't see in today's world. Of course, this might be a bit of an exaggeration as the show lacks realism. Yet, it's a mixture of sadness and pity to see Ai venture on her task as a gravekeeper especially later on. 
 
Despite not being a battle shounen, the show does venture into the action field in a few episodes. It's also surprising to see Ai being able to fight at someone her age. The phrase 'dynamite comes in little packages' fits perfectly for her abilities early on as we witness her skills in the art of combat. Other characters shows off their skills as well in particular Hambert in the beginning and later on Alis with his skills too. Unfortunately, the series isn't designed to look flashy with combat factors so action junkies might be a bit disappointed after completing this show if you're looking for spectacular action. It's also hard to take the series seriously sometimes especially since shovels seem to function as a source of weapon for gravekeepers. Let's not also forget about Ai's age for someone of her age along with that adorable face. It's somewhat hard to imagine that she undertakes a task that is as grim as being a gravekeeper.  
 
Taken a point mentioned earlier though, the series builds on the grim reality of a world where God no longer exists. He literally abandoned the world fifteen years ago, so you might ask yourself “now what?” Well, if we look carefully, there's zombies roaming on the surface and gravekeepers have to bring order. Most of the gravekeepers themselves are cold but Ai is a girl who seems to be cheerful and caring towards others. We might consider the fact if gravekeepers are born differently or how they came to be. There's a puzzle in identity crisis that exists here that I find a bit troubling as most of the gravekeepers goes on unnamed except for a few prominent characters. Furthermore, the zombies that realms the world are depicted as being undead, acts undead, but seems to very much alive. It strikes me here as a bit of silly but also at the same time intriguing factor to notice in such a world. The purpose of the gravekeepers are also sometimes unclear and their moral standards are up for the imaginations. 
 
If beautiful was a word to be used, this show would fit that category perfectly in terms of its art standards. Maybe this show could even be titled “Beautiful Sundays Without God”. Madhouse Studio surely set the standards high with its background imagery for this series. It's beauty with expression that is illustrated through its holy like background and sunny atmosphere. At some occasions, viewers might feel as if the world this series takes place in is a dream one might not want to wake up from. (going by art judgement only) On the other hand though, Ai's character might be a bit difficult to get used to with her design especially her petite figure, moe like eyes, and antenna hair. Hambert's albino hair is also noticeable as well. All in all, the artwork expectations are met and I give praise to Madhouse Studio for their production values. 
 
The soundtrack of this series maintains its consistency. The OP song ""Birth"" by Eri Kitamura spells out that holy atmosphere of a world without God. The ED song also illustrates its points through its fantasy elements and background artwork. In terms of OST though, the series retains its theme well especially in more of the emotional scenes. It sets forth that style of tragedy but presents it in a more dramatic way. This is clearly shown in the beginning and other times later on. As for voice acting goes though, average might be a word to describe its casts' performance. Because most gravekeepers seems to lack a personality, there is little to go by with their voice tone. Other times, they are hardly noticeable at all. 
 
If God truly took a holiday, then this show would be one living hell for everyone. But we look at it carefully, sundays with no God might not be so terrible after all especially with the gravekeepers in check to keep order. The effort to illustrate a series with this type of style is certainly unique and not something viewers might be too used to these days. With minimal fan-service, this show definitely sets forth its premise standards well. For Ai, she is on a journey of discovery and learning more about the world. For people interested in this show though, I hope you discover an enjoyable experience out of this. God may have abandoned the world but abandoning this show would be a chance of throwing away a golden egg.

    Sunday Without God is definitely the ""surprise masterpiece"" of the Summer 2013 season. I picked up this anime at the beginning of the season not because I had heard about it a lot previously, but just because the plot synopsis seemed interesting--Very glad I did.  
 
The anime focuses mainly on ""Ai,"" a girl who is attempting to find her path and purpose in life. She lives in a universe where god has abandoned the entire world, which has left some adverse side-effects, naturally. Humans can no longer reproduce, and even if a human dies he is not really dead--He/she still functions as a normal human, but they can never be at peace. Before his departure, however, god appointed ""gravekeepers"" to preside over the dead. If you are dead, and you can get a gravekeeper to bury you, you can truly die and be at peace. Ai is one of these gravekeepers, and she is on a search to find herself. While I can obviously go no further into the story in order to avoid spoilers, I can say that the story is *extremely* engaging and is constantly developing. The amount of emotion and depth that the studio was able to pump into twelve episodes is staggering.  
 
Populating the story is a cast of extremely diverse and lovable characters. While time is spent on certain ones more than others, they all contribute to the story in important ways. Even characters that only appear for an episode or two are still very memorable. Definitely one of the best overall casts I've seen in a while.  
 
The art and sound matches up with the rest of the anime in their quality. Vibrant colors and moody lighting effectively bring the world to life. The soundtrack is definitely superior to the average fare, especially some of the tracks meant for more emotional moments. The OP and ED both shine as being fantastic, the ED even more so--It's one of the best I've heard in a while. The voice acting is also top-notch--No complaints here. 
 
As short as Sunday is, there's really no excuse to not at least give it a go. The plot is engaging and emotional, the characters are dynamic and colorful, and the quality of the art and sound bring everything to the point of near perfection. I think that I definitely name this one my favorite of the Summer 2013 season.

    If God suddenly decided to abandon the world, what'd happen to its people? If no one else can be born however, no one else can also die, what'd happen to Earth? 
I'll try to keep the review as spoiler-free as possible but if I do post one, it was an accident and I apologise in advance. 
 
Story [8/10] 
 
The plot is actually, in my point of view, really complex. God abandoned earth, in this ""new earth"", people can no longer be born however, people cannot die as well. 
However, before giving in to the world, God left behind ""Gravekeepers"", gravekeepers are the only ones capable of actually killing, or to be more specific, ""put ease to the souls"" of the dead by burying them. 
 
The story begins with a girl named ""Ai Austin"", she's 12 years old and she belongs to the last generation of borning humans since god abandoned earth 12 years ago. Ai's a gravekeeper and eventually embarks on a journey to search for herself and later, save the world. 
 
Art [9/10] 
 
The art matches with the theme of the anime and their quality is top notch. The characters are well drawn and I didn't feel any kind of ""lazy animation"" throughout the whole series, all the colors are adequate with the theme and style of the anime. 
 
Sound [10/10] 
 
I really really loved Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi's OST, the OP and ED were both really addicting and equally good and the OSTs blended really nicely with the scenes, it comes in the right moments and really helps establishing and improving the emotion of the watcher because let's be honest, mood-music is the best thing ever and adequate mood-music it's even better. 
 
Characters [7/10] 
 
I will confess that I felt kind of annoyed by Ai in the first couple episodes for a 12 episode anime her development was really well done and by the end I had already fallen in love with her and all the other characters that came across her way. 
The development is really well done for a 12 episode anime and I was able to understand and feel emotionally connected to all characters, share their suffering, pain and problems. 
 
Overall [9/10] 
 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi was a great anime and probably one of the best this summer. The characters are unique and not really cliche'd, are nicely developed, allowing you to feel connected to all characters, the plot is entertaining and different and merging with different themes that usually aren't a part of only one anime. The art is of good quality and the soundtracks will give you plenty to look forward too even after you finished the anime (I'm looking at you, ED song). 
 
If you're looking for a good story, with interesting characters a some plot twists, then Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is the anime for you, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I and others did. 
 
Thanks for reading my review and have a great time watching Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi.

    So this anime started off a bit odd, as it progressed it became more odd and i thought the story would be completely different. Nonetheless the anime had me crying happy tears by the end. Though i wish there was more to it. I highly recommend watching it, if not for the walking dead than for the hint of romance everywhere and the heart wrenching goodbyes. Oh it was so lovely. The ending might make you really angry at first but continue watching and you will be pleasantly surprised my dear anime lovers, if your looking for gore, love, zombies, and a hint of magic, this anime gotcha covered.

    My anime of 2013. 
a Short Review/Recommendation from me! 
This anime really ticked everything i wanted. 
-Not full of fan service but still a cute protagonist 
-Had to be deep 
The anime kept the tension up the whole way for me, there were sad and happy moments and shit i loved all of them 
 
 
[STORY:9] 
The story and background setting is great, very well thought out and explained through the series so its easy and fun to keep up. 
Character development was spot on for me as well. I can say I genuinely cared for all the major characters, each have their own flaw but they all have a genuine good side - none of that stereotypical evil villain rubbish here. 
 
[ART:9] 
Beautiful, just stunning the designs, the flow, the effects. Would go for a 10 but then it would have to match or top the series ""K"" 
 
[SOUND:9] 
Voice actors are perfect for the roles

    Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi (Sunday Without God)- This anime was a mixture of good and bad. It was a pleasant surprise but at the same time was  a lot of wasted potential.  It definitely would have been better with 24 episodes, but it was still a solid 7 despite its problems.  
 
Let's start with the good. The best aspects of this show are the art and the music. The artwork is gorgeous and has everything you could want in an animated work: vibrant colors, detailed scenery, fluid animation, realistic character designs, and a variety of environments.  
The music is just as good as the art in terms of how much of an impact it has on the show. The ambient music is perfect and adds a surreal feel to almost every scene. It really makes this already unique world feel even more unique. Both the OP and ED are also very good, with the ED being one of my favorites.  
 
 The world that is built in this series is by far one of the most interesting worlds I've seen in awhile. It's a mixture of post-apocalyptic with both modern and medieval architecture, both living and dead, and different races - human and gravekeeper, along with the power that wish fulfillment can bring in a world essentially devoid of rules. The way everything flows cohesively together in this world abandoned by God is really nice to see and it's one of the most unique creations I can think of.  
 
The downside of this show is that it wasn't able to fully capitalize on the world it had to work with. Things felt rushed, the world wasn't explored to the capacity many people would have liked to see, and the story itself suffered from poor writing and poor characters.  
The story has 4 important arcs: Valley of Death, City of the Dead, Goran Academy, and Class 3-4, in the order they take place in. The first 2 arcs were very good. They did a good job introducing the viewer to this fascinating world and explaining how it operates now that God is no longer around to oversee its happenings. The City of the Dead arc is especially good at offering more insight into the world in both lore and environment. The Goran Academy arc is by far the lowest point in the series. Thankfully it's only 2 episodes long, but those 2 episodes were painfully uninteresting compared to the rest of the series. It's really immersion breaking- that's the best way to describe it.  
 
Speaking of the Goran Academy arc, the characters in the show are another weak point. Too many characters are introduced and flung to the side shortly thereafter, and the mainstay characters suffer because of it due to their screen time being interfered with. The Goran Academy arc is the worst of this dilemma, with a plethora of characters being thrown aside as soon as the arc ended without there being any attempt to develop them at all. The worst part is that the writing tries to force drama that isn't there because, well.. Nobody cares about these characters.  
The main cast is honestly not that bad- Hambart and Alice in particular are very interesting characters with strong personalities. Ai is a bit of a hit-and-miss. She's a likeable character overall and is less annoying than your typical young female lead, but she still suffers from some of the same tropes that you would expect (being overly naive, being overly stubborn, and showing an alarming lack of awareness in some situations).  
 
Overall, Sunday Without God is worth a watch. Despite the Goran Academy arc in the middle and an overall weak cast of characters, the rest of the arcs (which are all very good) and the few good characters are not overshadowed. The superb sound and visuals do a lot for strengthening the show as well.  
Sunday Without God is not a bad show by any means, it's just not as good as it could have been. I still really enjoyed it, and I'm sure any fan of the Mystery genre or anybody looking for a unique world (which is rare to find these days) will enjoy it as well.  
 
Story: 6/10 (Great and very interesting world but average writing overall) 
Art: 10 
Sound: 10 
Character 5: (Some good characters but just way too many irrelevant ones) 
Enjoyment: 7

    Hello 
 
Please note that there are few SPOILERS in my review.. So... only read it if you have already completed this series. 
 
Don't know what i was expecting when i started watching this. I did read its description before watching though, it seemed like something of a fantasy with little bit drama. It was cute until that unexpected and heart tearing moment in episode 3. I was like a WTH moment!! and disappointing and unexpected. The sole purpose i started watching this damn thing was because i wanted to see how the father/daughter relationship goes after being reunited. But that was for a very short time. Why the heck he had to be dead in the in very early episode. I thought that i won't be able to watch anymore and the same happened, i couldn't. I had no idea what to expect out of it anymore. 
Maybe i was expecting too much of it. 
 
It had a great potential until her father awakens as living dead. This anime could've become a masterpiece yet failed deeply. Atleast for me. 
 
You may like it or not it depends on you. Everyone has a different prospective after all.

    Here we are with another show with a very interesting setting and a very dull and randomly written plot. The premise is about God abandoning the world, which in the context of the story means no more people can be born. It also means no people die when they are killed *smirk*. They turn to zombies who act normally for awhile and only those with special powers can put them to eternal rest. Enter Ai, our heroine, an oblivious loli traveling the world looking for answers to all this mess. 
 
… And that is literally all there is to it. It is one of those slow burner shows of the likes of Cashern Sins or Kino’s Journey where the atmosphere is more important than plot or characters. And for the same reason it is quite boring too if you expect action, suspense, or shocking revelations. It is also quite retarded if you try to make sense of it. 
 
At least the atmosphere part is done right, as it makes good use of the premise and it’s not there as background decoration, like some shitty Dog Days variant. Most of the plot is dedicated to showing you how people are trying to cope with this new way of life (or should I call it unlife?). It also does that by having a balance between sad and cheery; meaning, not depressing and inhumane like Technolyze nor goofy and trashy like Neptunia. It stays true to its gloomy premise and makes everything to feel sad and even elegiac in a way without resorting to the overused goth fad we had a few years ago. Forget that macabre style of Nightmare before Christmass everybody was ripping off for almost a decade. It actually looks quite bright and colorful with the only indication something is off being the moody background music and the dull way everybody acts or lives. It even does a good job at keeping you wondering what is going on with this whole “God has left the building” issue as means to keep watching. 
 
Aside from the atmosphere though everything else is barebones. The characters lack any real charisma and pass as too obvious plot devises to care about. They are also contradicting themselves every 5 minutes. It is also questionable if you can even tolerate Ai for more than 10 minutes, since she is yet another oblivious loli that is occasionally presented as a fetish for pervs. 
 
As for the mystery part, the show is only 13 episodes and most of it is spent traveling to different places and meeting different people instead of focusing on fleshing out the main characters. That may feel like placing a lot of focus on world-building but only manages to leave the cast as empty shells and the setting as random ideas with no continuity. Meaning, there is nobody at the epicenter from which we can see the world. Ai has barely any personality that goes beyond that of a stupid girl going alone in dark alleys full of crooks. She is not worthy to cheer for and worths not even SE Lain’s pinky finger. The rest of the characters don’t even represent some ideal or mentality, since they change their perspective on live completely every 5 minutes. You can find several scenes per episode where a character says one thing, only to contradict it a few minutes later. Even the mystery which seems so strong at first fades away fast when you realize nothing is making sense. 
 
What gives the gravediggers the power to kill the undead? 
 
It can’t be God, that’s for sure, and there is no other reason given. “Ah, but they will explain it later” one may say but even then that means you are supposed to believe anything they tell you. If the whole setting is a mystery and you are supposed to gradually learn about it, you have no other source of information past what the characters are telling you. And they are almost deliberately contradicting themselves as means to confuse you and by the end of the episode not really telling you anything. Here are a few examples: 
 
Ai: I am a gravedigger. Actually, I am not. Actually, I am a hybrid. Actually, I am too one of a kind to explain what I am, so just take it as granted. Humphrey killed all my friends and beats me up all the time. I guess he is my new best friend. Let’s have fun together. 
 
Humphrey: I can’t die. Oh, now I can. Gravediggers are emotionless robots. But Ai’s mother was a kind woman. And she was also a gravedigger. And gravediggers can’t have babies. But she could. I want to kill Ai. No, I just want to beat her up. No, I just want to give her a piggy ride and do silly comedic stuff with her 5 minutes after I killed all her friends and family. 
 
Yuri: I want revenge. Actually, I want to die. Actually, I am fine and don’t want revenge or to die, so let’s travel the world together. 
 
The above mood swings don’t happen gradually throughout the show. They happen within the SAME episode. How can the viewer be interested in a mysterious setting that is changing every 5 minutes? There is no truth to look forward to if they are constantly trolling you like that. There is nothing to accept as granted and no time is invested on something for you to care about. And even if you manage to make sense of it all in the end, there will be no reason to wanna revisit such a series that is mostly trying to fool you with red herrings and fake claims. It is essentially making you feel like an idiot and it’s a very good example of bad storytelling. Also it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the answer to most of the mystery is Ai herself since she was born special; so again I am not made to feel I should care about the revelation if it has to do with a sexualized plot devise. 
 
The show is not even being subtle about its topics to the point it trashes them, despite the good balance in atmosphere. It does not try to integrate the everyday lives of its main characters to the main conflict; since they are always on the move and their goal is to basically kill any undead they meet instead of using them as means to offer a steady way to learn about the world. And the themes are way too heavy and edgy, as they have to do with rotting corpses and occasionally mutilation while occasionally switching to Ai doing some moe-moe nonsense. This is nowhere near the masterful way Haibane Renmei used to show some really deep themes through basically nothing more than everyday life. 
 
Bottom line: If you want to watch a show with good atmosphere, this one is a good pick. But everything else from characterization, to excitement, to subtlety are quite weak.

    *I included as few spoilers as possible 
 
There are few anime who, after I finish watching them, I have to scratch my head. Even fewer make me simultaneously want to review the story itself and post it online. Sunday Without God is one of those irksome shows. 
 
Story 4 (This show really is a cute girl doing cute things) 
 
I picked this series up because its premise sounded amazing. I am a sucker for religiously-inclined series, and this one seemed to fit the bill perfectly. The show's two opening arcs were nothing short of amazing, if a bit campy. The series explained the setting while also bringing to light the conflicting views of safety and security in this new world, and how each person seeks to attain them. It was beautifully done with the only issue being the complete campy-ness of everything. This show is slice of life, make no mistake, it is not extremely dark like the opening or themes would have you believe.  
 
My problem comes in two forms; one is the tone, and the other is the ending. The tone of this, as I said is very slice of life, but its concept is much less than so. The slice of life aspect of this show ruins many of the themes because it is like the show itself is not taking itself seriously. I could not tell who this story is for. The people who like slice-of-life will be off-put by the random and graphic violence, but those who like darker themes will be put off by the storytelling that is reminiscent of bubblegum, cotton candy, and rainbows. Maybe there is someone out thee who this show is perfect for, but the tone, to me especially, seemed way too varied to really take it seriously. 
 
The ending... is another matter. This is one of those shows where everything literally stops mid-story without any resolution. Unlike similar shows such as Kino's Journey, the series doesn't even give you any final words. It. Just. Stops. This would be okay, if the viewer were not left with a dozen questions. The show does not explain the nature of the wishes God gives the world or how what happened at the end of the final episode, even happened. I could have ignored the tonal shifts, but the horrible ending and the fact that the final two arcs were so similar to one another (same settings and themes) dragged this score down at least 3 points. 
 
One last thing to note is its poor execution of Chekhov's gun. I can't give specifics, but there are events and things that happen that do not come up again, even though a big deal was made of them to begin with. It happened more than six times in this series, and really brought down the overall message, as well as the characters. 
 
Art 9 
 
The artwork in this is gorgeous, in that hyper stylized moe kind of way. I don't have many complaints save for the fact that there were awful uses of CG and the characters often did not quite blend with the gorgeous backgrounds provided. Otherwise, I thought it was great. 
 
Sound 6 
 
The sound is usually really good. The opening sequence is ear-catching with its swelling choir and snippets of English phrases and the ending is one of my favorites of all time. But other than those two, nothing really stands out. None of it is bad, but it's not great either. The music is also not very versatile. It tells you exactly how to feel and when to feel it- with no interpretation left to the viewer. If it's sad, you're supposed to be curled up into the fetal position bawling. If it's happy, you're supposed to be skipping and laughing. Etc.  
 
 
Characters 5 
 
Sunday Without God is a mixed bag when it comes to its characters. Sure each of them have well-thought out motivations and solid interactions between one another, but those interactions and motivations do not match up most of the time. A character's backstory will be presented and a few personality quirks alongside that, then, the character just goes off and does random things that have nothing to do with their personality in the first place. I'm talking about the fact that the village that raised our main character is brutally murdered, and what does she (the caring and loyal Ai) do? She of course goes with the man who killed her village. Makes perfect sense! There are numerous instances of this, and it got very annoying very quickly. 
 
The biggest travesty to the characters is that they all act so happy all the time. I get that the main character is that way, I will not complain there. But many of the others are just happy for happiness' sake. It's unreasonable to think that in a post-apocalyptic future that no one would be experiencing extreme depression or despair- that's just not possible. This campy feel added with the slice of life tone, just ruins much of the interactions of the characters. 
 
Enjoyment 5 
Overall 6 
 
Overall, I don't regret purchasing this series. It's not terrible. It has many very touching moments and the colors and animation are very pleasing to the eye. I just didn't like it from a technical standpoint. Despite my negativity, this show is not awful. It definitely has some problems in it, but for what it is, it's not bad. I just hoped for more out of a series with such amazing animation, a great premise, and an opening sequence that was inventive.

    I had been looking forward to the day I watched Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. Now that I've seen it, I wish I had stopped at Episode 6. The story premise is great, as are the first six episodes, but after that it all falls apart. The anime is told in miniature arcs, each of which are 3 episodes long (although the arc from episodes 7-9 is a bit disjointed, while also being the weakest).  
 
The first arc introduces the main characters, the premise for the world's state, and sets up a grand adventure. Out of all the arcs, it is probably the best and, in my opinion, they should have just expanded the first arc's plot into a 12-episode anime and had done with it, having the start of the cast's grand adventure as the conclusion and a premise for a potential sequel. 
 
The second arc is the first step on the adventure that the first arc sets up. It further expands the original world premise of the how the living, dead, and gravekeepers all interact, and does so with a moving tale and a cast of intriguing characters. 
 
The third and fourth arcs, however, come out of left field. The third suddenly changes the setting to that of a stereotypical school anime, all while introducing a needlessly large cast of characters, most of whom are quickly thrown away after two episodes, and all of whom receive meager development. The fourth arc takes the remaining characters that were introduced in the third arc and develops them. However, in their attempt to do so, the writer(s) end up branching too far from the foundation of the world's backstory, making the entire arc feel like it has nothing to do with the world of Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi in the first place. Throughout the third and fourth arcs, some of the major supporting characters are left by the wayside in exchange for a poor attempt at connecting the audience with a new supporting cast. 
 
Ultimately, this anime is bipolar. The first half deserves its relatively high average rating on MAL. The second half, I couldn't rate above a 3 in good conscience. Therefore, I'm plunking it on a 5/10 - somewhere in between. The great balances out the bad to create an average score.

    This visually beautiful anime is based on a fascinating concept, but ultimately lets down its ambitious premise. 
 
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Kaminai is about the value of an individual life and what it truly means to live or die. Will removing death and birth from human experience make life more or less vital? In the first half of the series, the show manages to subvert or avoid many anime clichés; characters die unexpectedly, underlying the show's message that life's brevity is what gives it meaning. Lost loves are really lost, forever. People make difficult, complicated decisions in a world that has no clear sense of right or wrong. 
 
Structurally, the show portrays our protagonist, Ai, meeting series of characters being trapped in unbearable worlds: worlds their families or friends create, worlds that strangers create, and worlds of their own creation. Each of these story arcs are resolved when characters choose to either break free of their bonds or to embrace the cage they have come to live in by acknowledging and accepting it. Along the way we meet strange and unique people and the equally unique landscapes they inhabit: a necropolis watched over by a goddess of death, a character who is the joint child of five people, an emotionless extra-human being who is made bedridden by the cry of an unknown child. Moments of humor and fun character interactions bring just the right amount of levity to keep things floating along, not quite getting bogged down in the seriousness of the moment, but never forgetting that the stakes are deadly. 
 
Kaminai's world-building is fantastic. The sense of society's stagnation and decay is palpable as we visit location after location of people, alive and dead, struggling to find meaning in lives devoid of both hope for the future and longing for the past. 
 
Best of all, the protagonist's optimistic, innocent attitude is shown to be naive in a grim and brutal world. This lends her a feeling of vulnerability and saves her from being an unwatchable 'genki Mary Sue' type. Ai gives us many uplifting speeches about the power of wishes and the value of loving yourself, sure, but we also get to see her being kicked wholeheartedly off of a bridge and discovering that her early life was a nightmarish lie perpetrated at the hands of those she loved most. 
 
Unfortunately, as Kaminai progresses, we find ourselves trapped along with the characters: the main story is never resolved, and the show's episodic story arcs become less and less impactful. Ai's quest to save the world never comes to fruition. Nor does she set aside her quest in a deliberate attempt to live life to the fullest. Instead, her special abilities and past are forgotten about as the main plot is sidelined by not one but two thinly veiled plot contrivances to get her into a schoolgirl uniform.  
 
First, the unique road trip story about a world with no death is turned into a hackneyed 'high school for gifted youngsters' tale for no reason. Then, Ai's quest is sidelined again for her to dote on a basketball-playing schoolboy whose Groundhog-Day-style story arc is played more for drama than to explore either the show's setting or explore its central themes. The show ends with a character being revived from the dead as a result of literal wish fulfillment-- this wouldn't be out of place in a normal anime with supernatural themes, but Kaminai takes great pains to show us the evil of such thinking. In fact, wishing to avoid the character's death is what caused the problem in the first place. Not to mention that any emotional impact stemming from his sacrifice is gone. 
 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is still worth watching, despite its unsatisfying ending. The characters are likeable, the world is interesting, and the visuals are beautiful. Earlier episodes make great use of digital animation during crowd scenes to make the show feel rich and, ironically, full of life. Top notch voice-acting and a decent soundtrack support the show as well. For the anime fan in search of a cute protagonist and something to pull your heartstrings and maybe give you a moment of reflection about what it means to break free of the prison your own worldview, you could do a lot worse.

    ""An immortal always desires one thing: a way to die."" 
Hampnie Hambart (Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi) 
 
This quote itself can summarize a lot about this anime. It's all about a new world, a world without god, and the changes this situation brings. We get to see despair, blood and death but, surprisingly we also get to see lots of smiles, normality and happiness. It seems that god doesn't make that much of a difference in the world, or does it? 
I think it takes some courage to bring up such a delicate and complicated theme to an anime. 
 
""Heaven and Hell are too crowded. It won’t be long before this world is, too. Ah, I have failed."" 
God (Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi)  
 
Well, but they made it and succeeded. Such an unique plot gets you really interested and you will find yourself asking: ""What now?"", ""What can they do now?"". 
 
This anime is divided into 4 arcs and it's kinda episodic. I mean, each arc is about something that, then, is kinda forgotten and thrown away so, if you don't like this factor I guess you won't enjoy it as much as I did.  
Also, the art is really appealing and suits the ambience in which the anime occurs. Oh, and the music/soundtrack is something else: besides being awesome, it has a perfect timing and suits the scenes perfectly. 
As for the characters, considering that this is a 12 episode anime, I think they made a good job: some of the characters are really unique like Hampnie Hambart and Alice. The only think they lack is screen time 'cause we see them coming and going really fast and that leaves you sad because they were really charismatic. 
Also, this anime is really emotional and that's where it excels.  
The story flows swiftly but calmy and you don't have that feeling that something is being skipped or rushed. And that's really good in an anime as little as Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi. 
Well, I enjoyed this anime and it made me really happy. 
 
Thanks for reading :D

    At first, what keeps me watching this anime was only because of 2 reasons. One is the opening song which is very good(IMO), the OP song gives me the same feeling and somehow it has the same style as the OP of Fate Zero. Then the second is its similarity to the popular JRPG 10years(or more) ago which is Final Fantasy X(my favorite rpg). Yes, the protagonist(Ai) has atleast 2 similarities with Yuna(FFX). They both have a mixed race and they both sends off the dead to where they should belong. 
 
So while watching this anime I really don't have any expectations at all. But after maybe 3 or 4 episodes, this anime really pull off something very good, that you might say WOW(or not wow cause you might cry). So if you're skeptic about this anime, I recommend you to watch atleast 4 episodes before you decide to continue or drop this anime. 
 
Now, analyzing the story and plot. This anime revolves around Ai's(protagonist) journey to a world that was believed to be abandoned by GOD. So, given that kind of world, this anime will present you many discoveries,irregularities and/or mysteries about the imbalanced world(since God is the one who maintains balance to this world). If we look deeper to the 12 episodes, we can divide it to maybe 5 arcs but imo there are 3 major arcs in this anime, as the other episodes/arc were used to give character introduction and character background/development(some sort of a filler). I'll call the first arc as the ""Hampnie Hambart Arc"", I can describe this as SURPRISINGLY and EMOTIONALLY GREAT. I believe this arc was the best arc of the series even though you might feel it was kinda fast paced. This arc will leave you a solid basis to the totallity of the series. The second arc is the Ortus Arc. Though this arc was a level below the first arc, I can still say it was very good. This arc will hold your interest through presenting a very dark world, its culture and its secrets. This arc was a change of pace from an emotional arc(1st arc) to a discovery arc. The last arc would be the ""Alice Color Arc"". This arc was almost at the same level as the 1st arc. It has an established characters since they were introduced on the latter episodes. The events in this arc was kinda predictable but still it has a very great twist that defined this arc. Summing up everything, watching this anime was a great experience, the setting and plot was refreshing and unique. Though it has many cliches and predictable scenes, the fantasy world and the twists made up for it. 
 
So my overall rating would be 9 which means this anime was really GREAT. I would recommend it to those who watch anime of various genre but not to those who watches only shonen anime. That's it. That concludes my review. 
 
Even though I think this anime was GREAT, I will still point out some cons. But be reminded that these lines were very opinionated and might contain some spoiler. Please don't read if you don't want to be spoiled. 
cons 
-The protagonist solves matured issues even though she's only a child who lived on an isolated village, and doesn't know anything about outside the village. 
-The ending was just an end of an arc. The ending doesn't conclude anything about the main plot(world abandoned by God). But on an optimistic view -- Yey.. it means there's still a possible season 2. 
-For me the humor was kinda flat. Its kinda awkward to insert humor in between serious parts/conversations. 
 
That's all. 
Thank you for reading.

    So what would happen if God really did give up on us?  
Whilst scrolling through the many reviews on this site, I found this little gem.  
I was completely unaware of what to expect and just wow... I will never regret my decision to watch this anime.  
I recommend this anime to anyone with a love for post apocalyptic/ zombie/ philosophical interests in life value and meaning and death. Or those who need a change of pace.  
For the past month I have skimmed through many titles and this is one of the first I simply needed to review.  
This anime is a diamond in the rough, there were points in the anime where I was unsure where the plot would end up. And there are also many areas I would of love to have seen expanded. This anime is too short. I loved it too pieces and the pace as nice but there are some storylines and scenarios which could've been longer. 
Righty no spoilers here I hope. 
Story - This is one storyline which will keep you guessing until the end. This is an anime which decided ... Dam this I want to be different. Its a daring topic to chose  and the story was pulled of very well. The general storyline revolves around the idea no one can die or be born and God has given up on the world. From this starting point, the anime explores many aspects of what a world would be like if this was the case.  I gave this a 9 because of the areas I felt needed expanding. But that is more a personal reason.  
Art - This is a very colourful and well drawn anime, I personally loved the art style and colour. Tick in the box from me here.  
Sound - I loved the opener and the ending song, throughout the anime there was a piano piece playing. Basically a modulation of variations of the main theme. I like piano so this ticked all the right boxes.  
Character - I felt most of the characters back stories and development was carried out in a very nice way. We see our main character Ai develop in an interesting way as she responds to the scenarios around her. I think this was carried out nicely and I found myself crying and really feeling for many of them. The writers really did do a good job on making you relate and feel for the characters. However it only got a 9 due to some areas again needing a tiny bit more expansion to help develop some of the other character stories.   
Each character is unique, there will be someone who you find yourself supporting. Due to such a complex topic there may even be times you find yourself thinking due to what they say and how they respond. 
Enjoyment - Full marks from me, I am so glad to have found this and hope that others also give this anime the attention it deserves. Maybe take a break from your slice of lives ? And try something a bit more paced?  
Overall - For anyone who loves a good storyline, art, philosophy or simply a good anime, I think this anime deserves a place on your plan to watch list. Or better still...watch this anime =D

    Kami-sama no Inai Nichiyoubi is one anime that immediately caught my eye. The description was intriguing and the art was pretty good, and so, I immediately started watching.  
 
Story: 
If I had to describe it in one sentence, it would be: it didn't live up to what it could be. This pretty much stems from the story. At first glance, the premise shows so much promise. A world where ""God"" abandoned the world, and therefore no one can die or give birth. From here, we have our protagonist, Ai, have everyone in her village slaughtered and then subsequently go on an adventure to save the world.  
 
Here's the first problem: what exactly is she doing? ""If God abandoned this world... then I'll save it,"" is what she says, but it's never really clear /how/ she's going to achieve it. In fact, there are so many side stories and deviations from the main story that we never actually get to it. For a 12 episode anime, the pacing is pretty terrible. It jumps from side story to side story with little transition.  
 
So, while the stories were interesting in their own right, we never actually get to the point, which is rather annoying.  
 
The second problem stems from the premise. We're told ""God"" is the one who abandoned this world, and then later discover that it might not even be true. So is there even a God? If there isn't, then how in the world did the world become like that?     
 
It's questions like these where the answer is ""that's just how it is"" that makes the storytelling so bad. There are so many little things that don't make sense either, and so many plot holes that are left unresolved. 
 
Art: 
The art was beautiful, I loved it! The scenery was detailed and calming, and there are some really nice shots of the world they live in. The character designs were really nice too - they were all pretty unique. I especially loved the design for Humpnie Humbert.  
 
There were some shots of the characters where I thought their hair was clunky and/weird. This especially applied to Alice/Alis, who I sometimes thought had way too much hair for his character.  
 
Sound: 
Both the opening and the ending sounds suited the anime well. They were calming and the lyrics just matched perfectly. There were soothing OST's that went with the tone, and so, I have no complaints in this department. 
 
Character: 
I really liked them, even in the short time that they were here. Although, that being said, I don't think enough of them got good characterizations, because the ""plot"" simply moved too fast past them to be sure. In the anime, There were about three or four arcs, and each had their own cast of characters. With the anime being as long as it is, that means about 2/3 episodes for each of those characters in that arc before it moves it.  
 
And so, there wasn't nearly enough characterization to be done on them.  
 
What I'm really mad at is Humpnie Humbert. Being in the description and the cover art, I thought he was going to be important. Turns out, I was wrong. I really liked him as well, and he has such a unique personality that I wanted to see him more.  
 
Talk about misleading. And disappointing.  
 
One other thing before I close this review is the language in the anime. It's so... inconsistent. Even their names seems to be very odd mix of Japanese, French, and Russian, I think. And the written language is French. I don't know what they were trying to do here, but I think they should've just stuck to one language.

    Whimsical would be the right word to use. This show is whimsical as hell. 
 
Floating distortions cover the animation as ""Godless Sunday"" tells the story of a cute little girl, who's half-human and half-Gravedigger, and the people she ends up being friends with. 
 
This world the story is based on is messed up. People can't die, can't reproduce... Are the dead people, who are still living btw, not zombies? They try their hardest not to become rotting corpses. But the only way for them to truly ""die"" is to be buried by an actual Gravedigger. (Jokes about the Wu-Tang Clan's spin-off ""horror-core"" rap group besides.) 
 
I picked it up because this naive little girl, Ai, bravely stood up after getting a beat-down from a guy who's, as we found out later, her father. But I watched it to the end because of the near-tear-inducing plot and the many twists and turns of this show.

    I have shows that I like to call 'Songbird Shows', which are shows that I decide to watch at some point or another for solely one reason: The Opening theme. Whether I hear it on YouTube or a friends shows it to me, these shows lure me into watching the whole deal simply because I love the opening theme. And with a show like 'Sunday Without God', you can't blame me for that being the reason I decide to watch because, frankly, there's not much else going for this show. 
 
Before I even go into the plot, I need to get something off my chest: 
WHERE/WHEN THE HECK DOES THIS SHOW TAKE PLACE?! 
Seriously. Everyone wear clothing that looks like it's from the 1800's, yet there are fully functioning industrialized cities (as seen in the special episode), and the main characters spend half the show in a van. Is this some special world that's just very similar to Earth or is it a far off country buried in the mountains in Europe? I have no idea, and I really wish the show had taken the time to explain that small detail. 
 
Ahem, where was I? 
 
So heaven gets crowded and God decides not to let people in anymore. This in turn means no one can die anymore, they simply grow old rot, and become zombie-like things. However, the solution to this problem is that God sent Gravekeepers into the world, people with the ability to bury the dead and have them stay dead. Where they go after they're buried is also not full explained, because, if we remember here, heaven is full. A young Gravekeeper named Ai ends up getting caught up in a big event in which her whole town is altered and she is forced to leave with a strange man. She then decides she is going to somehow save the world from the purgatory God has made of it. It's really is an interesting plot and concept, but it's executed really poorly. Not to say that the story is bad, nor are the individual arcs (the last one in particular was very well-done) but there are so many unanswered questions and concepts that get thrown aside because the plot wants to work, and at times, it really doesn't. 
 
Ai is a boring 'save-everyone' hero who always wins, even when she loses. Humpnie is a great character, but is hardly in the show. Yuri is the wanna-be father figure. Scar is the emotionless one that develops emotions. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh It's boring guys. All your great characters are there for such a small amount of time before you move on with your boring leads again. I loved Humpnie. I loved Kiriko and Ulla. I LOVED Alis and Dee. But the show would rather show me Ai doing...nothing than show me interesting characters for more than one arc. If the show had another season and we got to see more of these characters, it'd be no problem at all. it would also give Ai a chance to grow and Yuri and Scar would get more screen time than the occasional 'check-in'. Characters are not awful or even bad, they're just standard. 
 
The production of animation in this show is like a weaker version of No Game No Life. that show had really bright, vivid colors that lent themselves to the excessive bloom lighting and graphical effects. Sunday Without God is not nearly colorful or vivid enough for that and it makes that animation feel forced on the viewer. Like characters, it's not a bad aspect of the show, but it's trying too hard to be special. 
 
Okay, finally something to praise. The opening and ending themes in this show are phenomenal. heck, even background music is pretty darn good. But this is a 'Songbird Show' for a reason. The theme is different from any other song I've heard and the lyrics convey the main point of the show very well. The ending theme is also really beautiful, though it took me a while to get a feeling for. 
 
Sunday Without God is not a bad show. It's a completely decent show by all means. But for me, the things it lacked took away too much from what it had. Even the things it had were taken away by the show itself that focused too much on moving on to the next big thing rather than cherish w=the good aspects it had for any given moment in time. I enjoyed the show, but not a whole lot. 
 
Positives: 
+The opening and ending theme 
+The opening and ending theme 
+The side characters 
+Decent animation 
+The opening and ending theme 
 
Negatives: 
-The main character 
-The side characters getting the boot every 3 episodes 
-Ending was abrupt and detracted from everything building up to it 
-Significant details are simply not explained well at all 
 
Sunday Without God is nowhere near the worst show I have seen (That belongs to like Death Note or something.....look, the ending was awful, get over it). However, it's certainly not that great of a show. If it sounds like it'll intrigue you, go for it, but for me, everything was standard and everything that stood out took a side seat to the bland things the show brought to the table.

    Imagine a world where there is no death, a world where no one is no longer born, a would where you cannot die and must continue to roam around until a specialised agent of God (A Gravekeeper) can put you to sleep (death)... That is The Sunday Without God summed up. This was quite a surprising anime to find as I didn't have that high expectation for it, but boy did it surprise. 
 
Story: 10 
I really, really enjoyed this story, particularly for its uniqueness. The whole idea of this, as well as the issues raised about death and family and community that are raised throughout the anime, it is just simply amazing for them to come up with an idea like this. The story follows the main character who is a young girl named Ai Astin and her travels around the region. The story is really split into 2 parts, with the first part focusing on the city of Ortus, one where you must be dead to live in, and the second part following Alis Colour and the attempts to free a society trapped in time, both of which are very enjoyable to watch and learn more about. 
 
Art + Sound: 9 
The artwork for this anime was splendidly done. The soundtrack was very good as well, appropriately setting the mood for scenes and creating the right sort of emotions within the audience. 
 
Characters: 8 
Ai Astin is the main character. She is a bright, young, exuberant girl who wishes to travel around and save the world. She is a very likeable character as well, however has nothing major that makes her stand out and be truly memorable. She mainly travels around with a gravekeeper named Scar whose personality is quite bland, and Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich who takes on the role of a father figure. The only other mentionable character would be Alis Colour who comes in during the second half. He is actually quite a mysterious character who has an emotional past and on the whole is someone who you can relate to; strong, determined and quite reserved to those around him. 
 
Enjoyment Overall: 9 
This anime was really something to see, and caught me by surprise to see something so splendid come out. It continually leads you down and path and makes you want more out of it as you progress, wanting to find out more about the world and how it functions and what could possible happen. On the whole I liked it and recommend it for those who are after something unique.

    Dont be fool by its cover page . It is not the heartwarming kind of anime though there some heartwarming moments in the anime series. It is very dark , sad kind of anime but with the cute little girl as the main protagonist. This main protagonist is given special job and special power that only the chosen one by gods are able to carry out . However , as she is still about five years old still , she did not know much and only started exploring the world after his dad came rescue her. As she is cute but weak , it makes one want to cheer for her the entire series for her to become stronger xd . Obviously that is not the point in the story (for her to become stronger.) The point of the story is just that these certain people ""gravekeepers"" are supposed to do their jobs as selected by the gods to bury dead people. Because humans made a wish to the god on sunday and they stopped dying . When humans stopped dying , their birth rate also stopped. This story will just be like the girl's and her comrades adventure to different places meeting different people and having experiences xd If you have doubts how good ........

     In a world where god has abandoned humanity the phrase: ""Becareful what you wish for...you might just get it"" could be considered the ""motto"" of this anime. 
 
Story 9/10 
While the plot is very deep and complex, the story telling we see is very light headed, much to the protagonists personality wich is kinda of ""Deus Ex"" type of resolution (a form of ending a conflict because one is God, thus the conflict ends on a whim). While we don't see much character development we do see a vast world where every corner can be exploited for a much more enjoyable story. Unfortunately the adaptation is very short and we are left with a huge cliff hanger. 
 
Character 8/10 
As I mentioned before, we don't see much character development aside Ai and Scar mainly because of the short lenght of the series. To make matters worse we don't see the way Ai will be saving the world. 
 
Art and Sound 8/10 
Sometimes the picture gets lost with the over use of lightning techniques and most of the sounds are average to what is expected in an animation.  
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
This is the kind of anime you watch when you're feeling a bit depressed. It has lovable characters and a story that will make you reflex on the boundaries of life and death. 
 
Its a good ""rejuvenate your mind"" series.

    This anime is where god was like I don't care anymore. On the day god left if you made a wish, that wish would happen to what you said even if what you said you didn't mean it, it would happen to its full extent, which the god was like there, don't ask for anything anymore. 
If you die you will turn into a zombie.undead where you are woke. 
You don't just bite and boom you're a zombie/undead.,you have to die. 
There are gravediggers which are like infinite, there job is to put the zombies to rest by putting them in graves. If you're not a gravedigger the process won't work.  
At first the gravediggers were there because the people couldn't die/rest so they wished for the gravediggers, that is why they are there in the first place. Then the people didn't want to die so they then started killing the grave diggers, they all formed a union where a whole area was for the zombie/undead. Well a group then goes trying to save the world and then upon there journey they help people and have mini story type things.

    “God created the world on Monday. 
On Tuesday, he drew the line between Order and Chaos. 
On Wednesday, he arranged each and every number. 
On Thursday, he permitted the ebb and flow of Time. 
On Friday, God explored every nook and cranny of the world. 
On Saturday, he rested. 
And on Sunday, God . . . forsook the world.” 
  
Based on the light novels of the same name, Kaminai, short for “Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi,” engaged many viewers with that first episode, by introducing us to a world without God. This isn’t the first anime to touch on the “God” subject, but it is one of the very few “Kamisama” anime I’ve actually seen, and very easily did I depict their similar unwillingness to deconstruct or delve deeper into the premise of their stories – thus, unappealing many viewers. However, I thought the premise was interesting enough to disregard those minor plot-holes. 
 
Kaminai follows a young girl named Ai. Due to God’s abandonment, the world can no longer die or reproduce. As a result, humanity turns to different means of living and new prejudices and mysteries are born. It isn’t until Ai’s encounter with a stranger named Hampnie Hambart, that she realizes her desire to “save the world,” which forces her on a journey to re-discover her own world. 
  
So why did God abandon this world? There are many theories that the characters touch upon as to why God may have abandoned them, but the story doesn’t dig any deeper into the question – it just sort of happened. Instead, it focuses more on deconstructing the new world that is born from it - via Ai’s journey. The storyline can best be broken down into a series of arcs, as Ai attempts to help those she encounters throughout her journey – filling in the role as God’s messenger, in a way. My favorite arc is probably the Ortus arc, but I believe each and every arc is enjoyable in its own way. Plus, the story touches on various concepts, like “wishes” and “prayers,” which I thought made the series really engaging.  
 
Also, it had some pretty good production values. The series is animated by Madhouse and even though there is a surprisingly low amount of head tilts :P, there is a lot of attention to the background, which results in some very beautiful scenery.  
 
The music was also really good. It made the atmosphere, for the most part. My only complaint would have to be the large amount of one-dimensional characters. I would have appreciated a little more depth in their character. Even Ai, who is supposed to be the main protagonist of the story, suffers from a lack of depth. Nevertheless, the best thing about Kaminai is its premise, which was my main reason for sticking around in the first place, so I can’t complain much. 
  
I’d say the turning point for this series is episode three. You either love it or hate it, or find yourself crying by then.

    Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, or Sunday without god as it's english translation is, is a very strange anime featuring an incredibly original idea that would probably interest most people.  Unfortunately, just like its Sentai filmworks cousin Yumekui Merry, it falls very flat in its story category.  Let us begin. 
 
Story (7/10): God abandoned the world.  A very interesting concept where he has ""failed"" the world, and closed off heaven due to it being full, and giving everyone immortality.  Because god has gotten rid of the law of death, people are no longer able to die, have children, or grow older.  That being said, when people sustain a life-threatening injury, their bodies don't recover.  People in fact will grow corrupt and selfish as their bodies decay.  On top of that, to counter that, God created the gravekeepers, who will sense any ""deceased"" person, and attempt to bury them in order to make them at peace.  I'm not sure WHERE these people go, but screw it, it's anime.  The story follows a girl by the name of Ai, the cute little protagonist of the story.  Being born and raised in a sealed off village in the mountains, Ai is the town's gravekeeper, and is watched over by the villagers in the happy and wonderful world that she knows.  That is, until a man by the name of Hampnie Hambart comes in and kills all the villagers.  From then on, Ai sets off on a journey to save the world, whilst following the strange man that apparently murdered everyone she knew (logic).  Though this comes off as an IMMENSELY original idea, there are many flaws with its execution.  For starters, the story isn't about finding out why God abandoned the world.  Regardless of how much that would've improved that story, they don't do that.  In fact, what they do do, is show the audience, the effects of the abandonment.  The anime features 3 different main arcs, each with different characters that show a new situation and mystery to Ai.  While this is good on its own, it comes off to me as side stories while not focusing on the possible main plot point in the first place.  However, it does bounce back on the complex idea of ""alive"" and ""dead"" in the anime, and shows quite a lot of diversity.   
 
Characters (8/10): Rather then talking about several characters in the anime like I usually do in my reviews, I'll be going over only one, as revealing the identities of the rest of the cast, would be considered as a huge spoiler.  Ai, as the main protagonist, is a 12 year old girl who is a gravekeeper.  As a bright, optimistic, and cheery person, she hosts an extremely child-like personality, that would probably warm anyone's heart if they saw it.  However, after the initial event of the first episode, she changes to the point that she wishes to save the world that God abandoned.  Pretty bold for a 12 year old.  As the story goes along, Ai doesn't actually change too much from what I can see, rather, she uses her experiences from without the story to combat the problem at hand.  She's definitely not your average little girl.  Apart from her, the rest of the main cast, including Hampnie Hambart, is shown to have a very large level of complexity which shows just how much time was spent into creating these characters.  Bottom line, I LIKE THEM! 
 
Art and Sound (9/10): For art, you gotta hand it to them.  The art in this show is amazing.  The characters can be compared to those of Angel Beats! where all the characters feature a wide array of light colors and a sort of godly looking look in their design.  The backgrounds are very well detailed and I just love how good everything blends in with one another.  As for sound, it's awesome.  It's opening is amazing sounding with it's energetic opening showing the hope and despair that is in this new world.  It sounds wonderful, and I listened to it every time I watched the show.  As for the ending... I love it as well.  It gives a very somber sounding feeling that gives a sort of calming closing, as if you were given peace.  Overall, I loved them both and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone who decided to watch it after this review did too.   
 
Personal enjoyment (8/10): From the general synopsis of reading it, I thought that this was going to be one of the best things I've ever watched.  And I was right, mostly.  From an individual arc standpoint, the anime does really great in terms of executing the individual arcs with well done characters featured in each one, which get influenced by Ai in some way.  This is something I like.  I'd probably give it a 9/10.  However, looking at the anime as a whole, I don't see it as good. The transitions from one arc to another are very sudden and random, which feels kind of awkward.  On top of that, the story did feel a bit rushed at times, and there were some plot points that felt uneeded and very stupid.  There are 2 that I can think of in particular.   The ending itself was a bit confusing as well, and leaves a bit of a cliffhanger, seeing as how it was quite obvious that the anime still needed to explain what the hell just happened.  Aside that, there is still ONE moment that I would describe as my favorite/hated/heartfelt/story changing/important moment in this anime.  And that is, the end of episode 3.  For those of you who have seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  This scene in particular is where I think the anime took a bit of a nosedive (like SAO).  For me, I think it was both unnecessary, and necessary.  It was both stupid, and brilliant.  It was well done and- you get the point.  Above all, Sunday without God is good with its individual story arcs, its aesthetics, and its characters.  It falls flat on its overall cohesive story, and...that's about it really.  If you want to watch something original and not based off of archtypes, I would highly recommend this.

    Woah, seems I've got a bit of, um, dust in my eye here - WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE FEELS? Welcome one and all to another Waldy565 review, where today we look at Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, roughly Sunday Without God.  
Story - The story does jump about, but is generally cohesive. Briefly: A girl called Ai is a being known as gravekeepers, who's job it is to find dead people. Her dad disappeared and her mum died (tragic, aye). Anyway, mysterious man slaughters everyone in her village (which I didn't quite understand, even at the end, but I'll get on that) - this stranger is actually Ai's dad! Him and another stranger called Yuri then fight, then Ai chases after Hampne (Ai's father). They look for another gravekeeper called Scar. Hampne gets into another fight, but dies (despite being immortal... I'll give my spin on the symbolism after this) and meets again with Yuri. 
Yuri, Scar and Ai go on a trip, and Ai is kidnapped by the Goran Academys version of the FBI, as she now must attend a school. Here she meets Alice (a guy) and Dee, among others. Few roadtrips later, we find Alice, despite looking 16, is actually nearer 30 as he comes from an alternative dimension that has been stuck in a time loop. He then makes everyone in this loop realise there in  loop (thanks to Dee) and everyone escspes. Yes, that is OVERLY simplified. 
 
I think the director had a hard childhood, life, and maybe considered suicide. Death and mass slaughter is prominent in this, along with a lot of people who 'leave' (die) and I think this is symbolising death and mourning. OK, yes, it's kind of implied with GRAVEKEEPERS, but, especially the last 2 episodes, you'll definitely see the suicide and death links. Hate to compare it to something as it's a great show in it's own right, but the show does scream, if you hadn't seen it by now, ANGEL BEATS. 9/10. 
 
Art - Love the art. Standard CGI but just it's SO different to normal CGI use, it's not all crisp and ""moe"". It's all different and awesome. 8/10. 
 
Sound - minimal, except at the end of each episode, a little, like,  sombre interlude played which didn't add much and the opening and ending songs aren't particularly memorable, but what I LOVED was the song in the last episode between Ai and Alice, but I'll say no more. It really did save the score from dipping, as you can see. 7/10. 
 
Characters - I've done brief bios in the story arc, but it's not what they do individually, it's what they do together. As said, they show the symbolism of mass murder, of mourning, of death, of the Kübler-Ross model (anger, denial, acceptance) - oh, there's a little optimism, but there's a general pessimistic undertone. But that in itself is the brillianceof the show. And this also acts as my overall enjoyment and conclusion of this review. Go in to this show as it is, and you'll find a quite generic show that then blooms into something you'll want to no more about and that you'll damn well nearly cry, if not you will cry, by the end (why do I watch such depressing stuff when I HAVE DEPRESSION. Ffs...)  
Go into this while having watched Angel Beats and you'll have a nagging feeling this has all been done before, but watch this then Angel Beats and you'll get the same feeling. Overall, highly reccommended if you enjoy shows like Angel Beats (which I did) and a good recommendation overall into the insight of human pessimism. Thank you all and good night :)

    This series asks a question I am sure we have all thought about at one point or another when confronted with the death of a loved one: What if we could not die? 
 
According to Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi the answer isn't some idealistic fairy tale. Without death there is no new life or rebirth in this world and without that the world feels fairly empty and devoid of life. In fact, I felt death's importance was highlighted by this series because it gave a sense of closure and ending to a life. 
 
The story is told as a series of connected arcs with very liberal use of time skips in between as we follow Ai and her companions journey through their world. This gives the story a somewhat disconnected feel which I did not appreciate, however this approach had the advantage of allowing more story to be told since the story often continues mid action and expects the viewer to more or less reason out what had happened in the interim between arcs. The arcs themselves I felt suffered from pacing issues, mainly they tried to do too much too quickly with introducing new characters and having them disappear from the story the very next episode, yet expecting their disappearance to somehow have an impact. Similarly, while we got to see much of the intriguing world that Ai lived in, the show only permitted glances at the different places and situations as to give the feeling that the environment was simply a storefront, appearing grander then they really were. 
 
Where the series succeeded was really in presentation. The art was absolutely beautiful as any of the stills from the show can attest. I can only describe the environments shown throughout the show as surreal, almost like looking at the world as a painting rather than a picture because of the color choice. Character design is always hit or miss but I think the show had good character design with all the characters well differentiated and nothing too quirky as to distract the viewer. 
 
I liked the world and the context this series presented which made me strongly want to finish this series. During the first few episodes the series really delved into issues about death so I expected that theme to continue. However the series really just switched into ""adventure"" mode where the tough questions were left behind, I expect this was a good decision for DVD/BD sales but it would not have been my preference. Overall, I would have liked to see a longer series or a series that didn't try to cram so many adventures into only 13 episodes because the pacing really hurt my enjoyment of the show.  
 
I would recommend this show to anyone who likes adventure shows like Kino no Tabi where you get to travel to various parts of an intriguing world, encounter a problem and solve it within arcs.

    Well, I've got mixed feelings about this anime. It was introduced to me by a friend (very enthusiastic about it). I'm not sure what to start with. At first, I thought I was going to enjoy the story even though the main character is a twelve-year-old [but looking like nine or so] cutie-pie girl. I'm not fond of this type. 
 
Alors, art first: wonderful colours, movement, lighting and details. That's undoubtly a very strong characteristic of this series. The same goes for the music. Everything fits perfectly highlighting what's needed in particular scenes. The music alone is touching, not to mention its role in building atmosphere. 
 
The main character is so young and raised in a village that you can't really expect much from her. She gets to speak out some noble, kind of cliche words, trying to say she relates to others' problems in a way. On the other hand you don't anticipate anything else but this. Not that bad. Still, she becomes quite annoying at times. It appears that freshly met people reveal thoughts or ideas she would never come up with. It's quite naive. 
 
The idea for the series is interesting and captivating. It twists the rules of living and dying, aand of course raises a few questions how such reality can carry on. The disappearance of God is drawn as main theme but... it quickly gets lost, somehow. 
Basically, we get to watch four short arcs. The first one is gorgeous, quite original, introduces the bizarre reality and of course the main character. Then it plays on emotions so much that I doubt anyone would stay untouched. I remember I was slightly worried it happened to be a short arc because things seemed quite rushed and it looked as if the case was closed for good. 
The second arc was good although not as great as the beginning. The idea seemed interesting but was executed worse. 
The middle of the show was the worst. Everything was quite boring, cliche, even senseless. I could see a lot of ""convinient"" solutions that left too much unexplained. A lot of characters was tossed in, which was unnecessary and only annoyed. 
The last arc was as beautiful as the first one, at least for me. I got engaged in the events and was nicely surprised with a plot twist. I'm glad the end appeared to be very good. I was afraid what to expect after the previous episodes. 
 
The story has got many plot holes. It becomes notorious and can disturb in watching pretty much. Many things stayed untold, unfolded. It simply feels... lacking. Especially that there isn't really any main plot but separate small ones. I suppose they would appear definitely more enjoyable if this anime were longer. It's just not enough episodes to cover all of the ideas. 
 
I love the opening episodes as well as the last events. This is why I feel a bit conflicted. I'm honestly disappointed how half of the show turned out. Aesthetics are on point, the story is far from that. However, I am glad I could see those great episodes, which I mentioned, because they were definitely worth it.

    This will be my first ever anime review so please bare with me ^_^ 
 
Story 6/10 
The initial idea of god abandoning the world seemed like an interesting concept and I was intrigued to see how the anime would portray it. Although after watching the anime this doesn't seem to be the main concept of the story, instead we get 4 story arcs set over 12 episodes which I felt were a little rushed and ruined the emotional moments, but still the story was still good enough to keep me watching.  
 
Art 8/10 
The art and animation of The Sunday Without God was beautiful, every scene was brought to life by the vivid colours and the use of lighting and darkness to portray the different atmospheres of the anime. 
 
Sound 8/10 
The OST was great and set the various scenes well from the sad parts to the uplifting parts. The opening and ending songs are what stick out to most though, the opening great at getting me excited for the anime and the ending is great for finishing off an episode. 
 
Characters 7/10 
Ai,the main character, s a great character with good development for a 12 episode anime. The other characters didn't get as much development but they never were annoying or completely pointless to the plot. 
 
I really enjoyed this anime, with it's strong points being it's sound and animation but overall it's just really good. 
Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi is definitely worth your time and if not already you should check it out.

    I might be over-rating this show but I believe this deserves over 10/10! 
I usually don't get emotional through animes, I'm more of a manga person as well, but this series got me going! I cried multiple times in some episodes and others I was so giddy for the characters. 
This anime definitely grasps its viewers and pulls you in quick. 
Only thing I had a problem with was the incomplete ending (oh and the ending itself was so GRR perfect but so mean to us loyal viewers!) but I'm pretty sure a second season will be upon us. 
Anyways definitely put this on the top of your to watch list!

    This is my first review, so this review might not be the best but whatever.... 
 
I used SUBS and no sound. 
 
 
The story is a 5 (mediocre). So basically, in my understandings, there are people living immortally and others just regular people. However, there are plot holes in my opinion that take away the ""good stuff"" from the story.  
 
The art seems to be pretty good (7) in my opinion. (of all the anime I have watched.) A sidenote: I watched it in 480p on Crunchyroll so it might differ. 
 
The characters in this anime seem to be appearing and fading out, as well as not much development (in my opinion). So I rate it as a 5. 
 
My overall ENJOYMENT of this anime is an 8 because it is anime. No pressure on it. 
 
Overall, averaging rating of this anime for me is a 6.

    Just a short review to pen my thoughts.  
I first watched this 5 years ago when it was airing. For some reason, I dropped it. I think it was because of how incohesive the story seemed to be at that time.  
 
But now, having matured, I can appreciate the story fully. Like you may have read in the Forum Discussions, many points and aspects were not explained or left to be ambiguous. But if you just thought about it, everything is actually inter-connected and the explanations are as clear as day.  
 
I've really enjoyed this anime and I think I'll pick up the LN now.

    Wow... Of all the anime I've reviewed this is definitely one of the most difficult to give a grade to. Based on the other reviews I've seen here you guys seem to agree, as I've seen scores that are absolutely all over the place. I can't imagine any scenario in which this show is anywhere close to a 10 or anywhere close to a 3- and I've seen both scores multiple times. Here's my take to the best of my ability, but, at the end of the day this is one of those anime you simply have to see for yourself. 
 
Art- 
 
The presentation as a whole deserves high praise. The art was very pretty throughout and in a few moments outright beautiful. Multiple of the moments involving death had a beauty and eloquence to them that I really appreciated. The animation is smooth and fluid and the art style fits the world the anime creates very nicely and never feels out of place. 
 
Sound- 
 
Inexplicably, there is no music or sound whatsoever on the blu ray main screen or episode select screen, which is weird and lame to begin with and even more so given how good the soundtrack is in this show. The music is outright beautiful and it really complements the often emotional messages the anime is trying to convey. 
 
The voice acting was above average and never bad but it wasn't ever fantastic either. The main character, voiced by Caitlyn French in the dub, provides a passable but generic voice performance. Overall there was a lot of mediocrity in the voice performances as a whole. Personally I think the best performance in the dub was provided by Tyler Galindo as Kiriko, but ultimately this character wasn't all that important to the final product. 
 
Story- 
 
The story here is really hard to talk about and rate for multiple reasons. For one, it's all over the place. It very much felt like this anime had four barely connected, standalone mini arcs that happened to take place in the same universe. Beyond that they felt disjointed, fragmented and very much lacking cohesion. I almost feel like I watched three or four different mini anime as opposed to one whole one. Interestingly, all four arcs were genuinely good as standalone products, with the second being my personal favorite and the third in my opinion being the weakest, but they simply didn't feel connected or relevant to each other. In fact, I'd argue damn near everything that happens in the first two arcs- which is the first half of the entire show- basically doesn't matter at all as far as the bigger picture plot is concerned. 
 
The other problem is that this anime is not actually about, or even close to about, what the synopsis and the back of the blu ray box tell you it is about. The main character is established very early on to be a gravekeeper- an extremely important supernatural being that can properly put the dead to rest, which no one else is able to do- and this is presented to be an extremely important plot point that I thought would be absolutely core to the anime from start to finish, but as it turned out that couldn't have been much further from the truth. The gravekeeper thing as a whole is CRIMINALLY under-explored and underdeveloped and quite literally- not hyperbole- the main character uses her gravekeeper powers to put the dead to rest in episode one and then once in episode three and then LITERALLY NEVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ANIME! It felt to me like the fact that she is a gravekeeper was super irrelevant after the third episode. I couldn't believe they did so little with this interesting, unique premise that I thought had all the potential in the world. 
 
Character development as a whole left a lot to be desired as the arcs are just so self-contained and separate from one another than you only really get to know a lot of characters for 2 or 3 episodes before they're gone forever. Very few characters ultimately matter in this anime and there certainly isn't a single character from this show I'll look back on and still remember or remotely care about one month after watching it. 
 
Enjoyment- 
 
This is such a tough category because the anime is artistically beautiful and has a lovely soundtrack from start to finish and each of the four arcs, individually, are solid and enjoyable. However, though this anime was not intended to be episodic it often felt like it was anyway and with the plot simply feeling disjointed and disconnected, you inevitably lose something along the way. For the most part I enjoyed and was entertained by what I was watching, but I was having a really hard time connecting with or caring about any of the characters. 
 
Overall- 
 
This anime is just... unique. I've never seen another anime quite like this, for better or worse, and it definitely wasn't what I was expecting (or even close to it) based on the description the blu ray box and the Wiki page provide. It's a show I ultimately felt ""somewhere in the middle"" about, though closer to positive than negative, and while I would probably recommend it at the end of the day it wouldn't be something I'd treat as a high priority watch or come into with sky high expectations. 
 
+A sense of beauty and eloquence in many of the sadder scenes 
+Beautiful soundtrack 
+Four distinct, solid arcs that are all nice watches on their own 
 
-Disjointed, all over the place story that lacks cohesion 
-Very lacking character development 
-Wasted, criminally under-explored base premise

    This series has an excellent premise and its graphics are ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! I also really like its Opening and Closing songs, character designs, and complex universe. 
 
I enjoyed the first half of the anime a lot because it revolved around both Ai's mysterious status as a gravekeeper (the main character) and the issues in society that have arisen as a result of the fact that people can no longer die.  
 
However, the second half of the anime was not nearly as good as its first half. The story strayed away from its original premise (there was less about zombie people issues) and suffered from a bunch of plot holes. I personally didn't find the 'school' stuff to be interesting at all. 
 
I would still recommend this anime though. The graphics are just wayy too gorgeous. Though the last half of the anime was kinda shitty, I would definitely stick around for a sequel too see if the series shapens up.

    Sunday Without God, is a story-arc series formatted a little akin to Kino’s Journey. There is no over-arching story, rather it follows our female lead, Ai, as she travels from one metaphorical town to another, and that’s the beauty of this series. Each story arc is beautifully layered with symbolism and allegories showcasing the significance of the line between life and death in a nihilistic world. There’s a lot to ponder about and a lot to relate back to the real world.   
 
Ai Astin is the perfect character to take us through the world of the series. Rather than simply acting as a catalyst, Sunday Without God does an incredible job fleshing out her personality and capturing that child-like innocence. Props to the dialogue, because whether Ai’s disapprovingly questioning the morals the current world has adopted or claiming the obvious, everything that comes out of her mouth feels so real. 
 
But with a brilliantly imaginative setting and a loveable female lead, Sunday Without God is not free from flaws. Its problems lie with its execution. 
 
Rushed and hasty to get from arc to arc, emotional attachment is nearly void. A certain character’s death put a nice, unexpected twist to the experience, but preceding scenes were too glazed over to evoke any emotions from me when the actual scene occurred. 
 
Side characters that accompany Ai on her journey are well-characterized but any development feels stilted, especially romantic relationships such as the one between Juliet and Scar. 
 
This leads to another problem where yes, the ideas presented are brilliant but because of the rushed pacing, it’s bound to leave many confused and inevitably frustrated. As much as I loved the setting, there are some major elements that the series pulls right out of its ass, even leaving me staring at the screen asking what the Hell I’m suppose of make of it. 
 
The series ends on a rather unsatisfactory note, putting a halt to everything after a rather so-so arc. A whimper rather than a bang, a final lasting impression didn’t come through to me. Rather I was left irritated. 
 
So yeah, whose decision was it to set this for one cour instead of two? 
 
Final Verdict: 
 
Story – Formatted in story-arcs and with no definite story was a good idea, but the execution is weak and rushed, causing a lack of the emotional punch that the series aims for 
 
Characters – Ai Astin is a fantastic female lead, and the rest of the cast is likeable enough, but due to rushed pacing. Development and relationships feel stilted, causing emotional attachment to be nearly void. 
 
Setting – It’s imaginative and immersive, chocked full of brilliant ideas and symbolism that work for the most part, but would have been far more effective with stronger execution. 
 
Production Values – Solid throughout. The music is qutie nice, but the gorgeous background art is the strongest factor 
 
Final Thoughts: Most people dislike this series and for good reason. Its execution is weak and the series is rushed, but for me at least, it was still quite an enjoyable experience.  
 
Rating: 7/10 (Good)

    This anime made emotional so I might be biased in writing a review. 
 
Story: 10/10 
   
          Though the story is a little bit complex it is OUTSTANDING! In the first episode the goal of the protagonist is to be the best gravekeeper in her little village. But because of some circumstances (it's a spoiler if I will tell what kind of circumstances however I'm sure that it's written in the plot that people in that village died because of one man.) she will leave the village and again another happening that will make her want to save the world. So from that point the story will transform into an exciting adventure. I'm sure you're confused about what I'm trying to say but I swear that this anime can really make you emotional. To be honest, I cried in the first 3 episode. 
 
Art: 10/10  
        
        How I judge art in anime? CUTE GIRLS AND BOYS! If the boy is freaking handsome I'll quickly watch it. If the girl is so f*cking cute I'll immediately watch it. For me this is the basic criteria in judging this field. Admit it, sometimes you fell in love with anime characters even though they're fictional.  
 
      But I will be serious. The art is really nice. From looking at the cover it's really nice and beautiful and interesting. The cover makes you curios about the story. The cover makes you want to watch it or read it. Fine, fine there is the basis that you shouldn't judge a book from it's cover but we need to be realistic that we do judge the books by its cover. It's the picture that pulls our interest.  
 
      I think i focused too much on the cover so I want to make it clear. The art of the cover is as beautiful as the art of the entire anime. It's beautifully done. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
     I don't have any complains about the sound. Since it's my first time writing a review in this format I really don't know how judge the sound however if we are talking about voice quality then I will no doubt give it a whooping ten. The voice is perfect although I can't tell if it's perfect or if people can easily understand them because I don't know Japanese. I rely on subs and I thank websites for providing them. But to make it clear, the sounds are awesome. 
  
     Opening and Ending songs. Usually I skip this part but once in a while listen to it, especially if it's really catches my attention. The songs in this anime really fit the story. The melody blends in.  
 
     Background songs. Marvelous. Incredible. The melody and the rhythm actually adds more impact to the scene. Very nice. It really enhances the scenes and give more feeling and emotion. I really blends in story plot. 
 
Character: 10/10 
 
   Creative. Totally creative. This introduced lots of character with different personality. Although I will say that some of their personalities are really common. So why I gave it a 10? That's because every character has a story. Everyone carries a beautiful story that made their character really interesting.  
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
   I think that you can really tell how much I loved watching this anime. But I will still explain it. This anime is adventure and when it's adventure there are lots of exciting moments and scenes. Also, this anime has lots of surprises. You'll be surprise in some revelations and solved mysteries. It's a really complex story that was born from a single idea which ""God left the earth."" Of course after hearing this you will hearing this you'll have lots of question. What will happen to the earth if the life giver is gone? People can't give birth. People can't die. When they are killed only their bodies die but their mind and memories remains. However their wisdom and memories will fade, they will rot and be no different to zombies or walking dead that's why gravekeepers are born to officially put their souls at ease. Realization: People DO die. Question: If they die what happens to their soul? Question: What happens if all people die. Question: What are gravekeepers actually?  
 
    You see there are millions of question however this anime flowed nicely . It answers the question step by step and were able to create a wonderful story.  
 
(I think you could also use this reason why i give the story a 10. xD) 
 
 
 
Overall: 
 
I'm sorry for being lazy but I'm ending this short cause I think i pretty much explained why I give this anime a 10. For me it's pretty reasonable and fair but as review writer all this judgement are based from my opinion and taste in anime. I'll be honest in saying that this anime is not for everyone. Some might in boring but some may even consider it as a masterpiece. For me it's an OUTSTANDING piece. Please let me know what you think about this anime.

This is such a bizarre anime. I’ve seen anime and movies with trippy imagery. I’ve read stories with pages of gibberish, yet few works of fiction left me with a sense of culture shock like this. Such anime are so original it’s hard to make them truly terrible, since the novelty value is there. Creators also tend to be as confused as the viewer, so they rarely reach their full potential. 
 
When you have a unique premise on your hands that doesn’t owe anything to any tradition, there are two ways to go about it. You can either go full retard, mine the premise for anything it has and throw the kitchen sink along with everything. Since you have no idea how your anime is supposed to work, all you can do is try everything and hope something sticks. There’s a famous anime who did this and it’s called Future Diary. 
 
The other route is the safer one. You let your story flow, but you never try too hard to understand it. You let characters interact and explore your world, but you refrain from anything too attention-grabbing. The anime will narrow its focus. Its structure will become almost RPG-like, giving the protagonist a basic objective to complete and finish it off. 
 
Sundays Without God takes the latter route, but the result isn’t a complete failure. Despite not playing with the structure, its setting and premise are so weird that the feeling of culture shock is persistent. The stories that make up the anime are also good enough on their own and take advantage of the setting. You cannot tell them in any other context. Still, something feels off. It’s not completely weird, not completely normal and leans towards the weird without mining it too much. The result is anime that’s enjoyable like an ordinary anime while feeling weird. 
 
The best thing about the anime is it unique setting and tone. It’s a perfect example of how you don’t need a lot of details to create a unique world. The world here is simple. God is gone, no one can get born and dead people don’t really die. It’s apocalypse in slow motion. We’ve had a lot of stories about what happens after the apocalypse and we tend to imagine it as something swift and fast. Here, the world is in the process of ending. 
 
Human beings are resilient things, though. Even if the sun will explode, we’ll most likely try to save something. Survival instinct is so strong that it defies rationality and free will. In this case, the world isn’t ending so much as life reaches its epilogue. Life isn’t bad, but it keeps moving in an ordinary pace towards its ending. 
 
What do you do when you’re the last generation? The anime is essentially about this, but it seems so weirded out by its premise it doesn’t really explore it. The first stories deal directly with these themes – one character is about to be the last of the last generation, which is the worst isolation you can have. The city of the dead is an interesting expressions of the Metaphysical Rebellion – how we can rebel against our circumstances and reject them. 
 
The structure doesn’t prevent exploration of these topics, since many shows used shorter length with depth. The method of storytelling gets in the way. There’s an objective to solve, and the characters spend more time trying to solve it. While the pacing isn’t thriller-like, it’s too fast for such a premise. It doesn’t slow down enough to show how characters exist outside the story. 
 
Characters’ existence outside the story is one of the best ways to convince us they’re real, to make us care about them and see their humanity. Stories are something humans create and we don’t live in just one. A focused storyteller shows snippets of other stories the characters can have, but then goes back to the main one. A master storyteller can imply these side-stories and connect them to the main plotline. The anime doesn’t do this. Its focus is too narrow. 
 
It’s a shame, because the storytelling is quite excellent. The format is familiar – we have a good, well-meaning character visiting people and helping them. Ai isn’t just a vehicle to tell the stories of these people. Her personality and position is directly tied to her role. In a world where everyone’s ready to die or desperately fighting death, she’s a piece of light. She’s the youngest person alive, a possibility that there might be a future. 
 
She’s not a lantern, though. When things go bad, Ai doesn’t say some nice things and the story ends. Often, she gives those pep talks but stumbles. The world is, after all, ending. Problems still exist and are hard to solve. Ai may be an optimist, but she’s a struggling optimist. We see her doubts, how much she tries to cling to her optimism despite everything. 
 
This is where the anime’s faults lay. Although this is an excellent usage of such a character, they don’t take it far enough. Ai struggles, but the creators put her so much in the role of problem-solver she doesn’t have time to ingest the struggling. There’s no time to see how the possible failures affect Ai’s psych. Stories don’t always end just like she wants them to, and that should influence her worldview. How do you stay optimistic when things don’t go as expected? Do you blind your own eyes? Do you become pessimistic, or do you accept things as they are? The anime never addresses these questions. 
 
The themes of wishing does make its appearance, but the creators aren’t sure what to do with it. People wish for things. Sometimes they come true, sometimes they don’t and sometimes they come true but the result is painful. It speaks volumes when a messy anime like Big Order addresses these themes better. They’re present, but wishing is not a plot device here and there aren’t enough angles to explore this topic from. It’s just there. 
 
The art style continues the weird nature of the quality. The character’s looks are distinct and memorable enough, but the art style itself isn’t. You can put these characters in a school anime and they wouldn’t feel out of place (except for the outfits). There’s variety in how everyone looks and the school arc lets them show off their designs, but nothing connects it. Characters shouldn’t just look distinct but there should be a style that connects them, quirks that make the design memorable and make you wonder what else you can do with it. 
 
On the other hand, the color schemes and backgrounds are beautiful. The anime finally fulfills potential. The colors are balanced. Light and dark tones are mixed. A burning red or a cold blue is are the dominating colors, and they have just enough brightness to make the world seem normal. There’s also a little darkness in them that reminds you that the world is dying. It’s a balance that’s hard to get. You can easily find yourself in bland colors, but here they’re the perfect mix of darkness and lights that fit the weird tone of the series. 
 
Sundays Without God is a flawed anime, but nevertheless an anime like no other. Its failures hold it back from greatness, and but their nature prevents them from being offensive. When it falls, it’s not because it does stupid things. Rather, it’s too afraid to play with its ideas. They stand on their own, and even as basic storytelling it’s good enough. Someone might one day run away with these and render this irrelevant, but until then it’s worth your time.

    Sunday without God is an outstanding experience that combines a menacing atmosphere, suspenseful situations, and a well-developed main protagonist into one of the most memorable anime in the thriller/tragedy genres. 
 
This anime is tremendous for many reasons.  Firstly, Ai’s character and her development throughout the show is something to behold as her kind and caring personality palpably serves as the moral compass in the brutal and horrifying setting this show has to offer.  We are introduced to Ai in the Valley of Death arc as her innocent and very young personality must already learn to overcome extreme tragedy.  She meets Hampnie Hambart who she thinks may have deep connections to her, but as it turns out his personality is extremely harsh and unforgiving.  The confrontations and interactions between Hambart and Ai during the beginning of the show sets the tone for the harsh and strong emotion Ai’s personality drives throughout much of the story.  The writers also utilize her character to push many grave and tragic emotions to great effect.  Much of the reason why these moments with Ai are so heavy is due to her personality being appreciably normal which effectively represents a young girl her age.  Therefore, when she is confronted with hardship she emotes as a very real and identifiable young child.  The result is tons of unrestrained emotion.  The writers also brilliantly use the heavily detailed animation to capture Ai’s expressions of fear and sadness throughout much of the opening and by the end of episode 3 we already feel a deep connection to Ai’s character, and the development does not stop there.  Throughout much of her journey we see Ai having to confront and discover the worlds many secrets and the meaning of being a gravekeeper.  In the Ortis city arc we see Ai’s personality grow further as her wisdom and matureness shines when she must confront the complex leaders and dwellers of the city.  This leads to many interesting and unique situations as she learns to deal with a complex world and characters.  This builds to a very intense and fascinating concluding arc in which Ai must apply her experiences to convince others to face the harsh reality of the world they live in.  Ai is not only the best aspect of this show, but one of the most impactful characters in the realm of the thriller/tragedy genres. 
 
This anime also features a plethora of beautiful cinematography, memorable soundtracks, and suspenseful sequences which work in tandem to capture the beauty and horror of the world God left behind.  This combination is effective because the writers treat the setting as a living character.  From the long drawn out shots of the sun shining on Ai’s village, to the suspenseful and eerie sequences of ominous music used to introduce the city of Ortis, the anime certainly pulled me into the world and provoked my interests.  The show also features a few sequences of extreme terror and violence proving the anime is unrestrained.  These sequences heavily caught me off guard because the writers amazingly use the phenomenal animation to show the beauty of the world, so when we are introduced to the more frightening aspects of the story coupled with Ai’s intensity it successfully constructs the realism of the setting.  Suspenseful sequences where Ai and her new friends discover unfamiliar elements of the world are also plentiful throughout the story.  From the scenes focusing on the expressions of the characters to the silent moments of their journeys throughout the vastness of the world, the writers know how to build anticipation and take “showing the story” to a whole new level.  All of these themes remarkably came together to create some memorable and intense experiences. 
 
This all being said Sunday without God is not a complete masterpiece.  Firstly, the show is told in three different arcs that do not heavily relate to each other by the end of the show.  As someone who watched this without any knowledge of the anime at all, I was expecting a payoff where all three arcs would come together by the conclusion, but they never did.  This left for a bit of a letdown ending.  Secondly, aside from Hampnie Hambart in the first arc, the side cast is not particularly that memorable or well developed.  Most of the time this is also due to the three arc structure as the side cast comes and goes to often leaving little time to feature a ton of maturation or development. 
 
However, these were all subsidiary issues.  I still loved this anime because of Ai’s journey and the sensational and intense atmosphere throughout the show.  If you are a fan of the thriller/tragedy genres you should definitely check this out.

    (Sorry for this being such a long review, but please enjoy.) 
 
""They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever."" - Oscar Wilde 
 
Many believe that love is eternal, and that even after death those who love, will always love. Some may disagree, but I believe that romance will last forever, as long as the two who are in love, love the other until death. Romance is not spoiled by trying to make it last forever. If the ones in love don't believe it will last forever, then they most likely have doubt in their love, and it will most likely end at some point. 
 
The opening may have seemed random, but it helps me describe what I want to say. 
 
Amagami SS, doesn't allow the thought of love lasting forever to occur for very long. The relationships that were built, crumble into nothing when the story moves to the next arc. When I finished the series, I couldn't find enjoyment from the romance as much, because I don't know what actually occurred. My disbelief of this anime centralizes on one question, who did the protagonist end up with? This question can not be answered because, the protagonist ended up either with none of them, or all of them. But for either of those answers to happen, it would have to be either a dream, or there would be multiple dimensions where the protagonist falls for each girl.  
 
You may be saying right now that ""anime isn't real, stop putting so much thought into it"", but let's think of it like it actually is real. The most likely occurrence would be that this was a dream. I can't go with the multiple dimension option because I don't know for sure if there actually are, so I'm choosing the more realistic thought. The problem is, nowhere in the anime does it say that it's a dream, which disapproves that idea. 
 
So basically, with all of that ranting over, I'm trying to say one thing, why did it have to be split into different arcs? I'm not saying I'm unhappy with it, because my favorite heroines got the guy, but it doesn't allow any story to grow. 
 
So, let me explain what I like when I watch romance anime.  I enjoy happy endings where my favorite heroine gets with the protagonist. It sometimes doesn't work out like how I want it to, but if the ending is a good one, then I will most likely enjoy it overall. I like a central storyline about the love interest with possible multiple heroines, but without the harem ending. I think the protagonist should choose instead of messing with all the girls and trying to keep them all. Sometimes the person who's picked may seem like a dumb decision to me, but at least it doesn't end without a decision. The heroine can't be a complete idiot, or someone who is really lame, but somehow always does the right thing, and obtains the girl. The story can't be too cheesy and have things that would never happen, actually occur. Romance anime should be made with at least some sense of reality.  
 
Oh, also I hate super, perverted protagonists. For example Ichigo 100% (he really bugged me). A little perversion is fine, as long as it isn't taken to a whole new level. 
Well, actually the perversion in this was sort of taken to a new level, in a funny way, not a super annoying, ecchi way. (You will see when you watch the first and second arc.) 
 
Now back to the review. 
 
Amagami SS defies what I look for in a romance anime in both a good way and a bad way. It splits the story up into 6 different parts, one for each heroine (plus a final episode for an extra heroine). The plus side to this is that all the heroines get a chance to be with the protagonist. Nobody is left in the dust with unrequited feelings, and all the characters are happy. The one thing that I truly dislike is that, after one arc, the relations that were built are reset, basically saying that the story had no meaning behind it. I'm not saying that I rather have a harem where the protagonist gets all of them at once and everyone miraculous agrees to it (which happens in a lot of harems), but I think the story should have only focused on one love, or make him to choose in the end (which would be a great twist that doesn't happen in many anime). 
 
How the story is split really effects the chance to know the characters better, and to like them more too. It pains me to see the protagonist interacting with the females from the older episodes when it's brought to a new arc. Nothing beforehand happened, and it's basically a new anime with the same characters. I know it's based off a dating sim game, but it doesn't need to go down all the different paths. 
 
I sort of went off on a tangent with my rant on why the separate arcs bugged me, so I'll get back on track. 
 
The story is basically six different stories which I enjoyed on the most part. But, as I was saying before (without digressing from the review) it's not enough for each character, and I think more of a story should be put into it.  
(Note - I know Amagami SS+ plus is out but I'm writing this as if I didn't know about it.) 
 
The art is a more realistic type. It doesn't have any unproportionate characters, with wacky hair colors.  
(Note - I don't really look into the art as much when watching anime so sorry if what I said doesn't help at all.) 
 
The sound is splendid. I highly enjoyed the second op, and a lot of the random music put throughout which makes the scenario even more interesting. Each arc also has the seiyuu singing their own ending. I didn't enjoy the endings so much, but that's just my preference. 
(Note - I also don't really look into the music very much when watching anime, but I did hear many little tunes that do add a great touch to the story.) 
 
The characters are wonderful on the most part, but you don't really get to know them due to the way it's split into arcs. The protagonist, Tachibana Junichi sort of falls into traditional harem protagonists. One who is perverted (only a bit), had trouble with girls in the past, innocent with girls, and other things that I'm too tired to list, but you most likely get it. Junichi, isn't fully like the harem protagonist, but I'm only saying this because Amagami SS isn't really a harem, so it's hard to explain. 
 
Overall, this anime was a fun one to watch. Nothing really disappointed me other than the way it's split and how short each arc was. I enjoy seeing all the girls ending up with the guy instead of allowing the story to end as a harem. 
 
So, basically if you enjoy a good romance, I would recommend this, as long as you're fine with it focusing on six different short stories instead of one.

    Amagami SS is not your traditional linear anime.  It is arranged in Arc's where they show how things ""could"" have gone with a specific female during the same time frame with the same male protagonist Junichi Tachibana. 
 
Don't believe the hype of the ""Omnibus Format"" unless you like seeing the same person (the male) doing the same things but just with different females.  Yes the girls have different characteristics but the guy doesn't and he falls short of having any real substance to him. 
 
I *really* wanted to like Amagami SS.  The romance side of the story would have made for an interesting full season.   
 
The Art was very good.  A crisp feeling with well drawn characters. 
 
The main problem for me is that at the end of the 17th episode I just really didn't want to watch the same guy doing the same things anymore.  It was so tedious to watch this character, who doesn't have much character!, that the prospect of watching him doing the same shtick for another 8 episodes made my brain crumple up into a little ball with a white flag sticking out of it that said ""Please! No!"" 
 
After all the fanfare and great reviews I really tried.  I tried so hard that I actually put it on my ""hold"" list for about 2 months.  When I went back today to look at that list I decided it was time to drop it.  I've finished some hideous anime series over the years but just couldn't force another minute of this one.   
 
I really wish I could have liked it.  
 
Maybe you will?   
 
 
If you find yourself around episode 6 or 7 wondering if you should go on... don't.  Just drop it and find another anime.

    Yes, this is indeed another generic romance story. A love story between a boy and a girl in high-school which sparks into a relationship, except it is six different girls this time (and no it is actually not another lame harem).  
 
Amagami SS  is told in a dating sim style that separates the show into 6 arcs, Each arc focuses on one of the six girls that the main character can end up with. Just this already sets Amagami apart from the other animes from its genre because you get to see individually how each girl interacts with the main character for a straight four episodes. In other animes of this genre, they would have focused on one girl then quickly switch to another in the next episode. Doing that makes it hard for you to get to know a character. However, Amagami SS does it right by really focusing on each of their characters and developing them each very well. 
 
This method of story telling does have a major flaw though. Four episodes for six different characters is not nearly enough. It was enough to make me enjoy each character fairly well, but it is not enough to fully develop them. There will be times when the story feels rushed and it will appear as if a whole step was skipped in the main characters relationship with a the girl. 
 
Even though each arc was too short, the story for each them are still very unique and different from each other. Each one is different than the one before it, so by the time your done you'll defiantly have a specific girl your rooting for. Some have more happy endings than others, but by the end of each you will definitely be satisfied with what you've seen. After one arc is over,the story switches to a alternate world or something. The events of the previous arc is null and void, so the main character is not just some player who moves from girl to girl  
 
Like i mentioned in the second paragraph, this way of story telling lets you get to know the characters more without having random interruptions. Each episode of each arc focuses solely on the relationship between the main character and the heroine and nothing more (so no fillers yay!). 
 
Moving on to the art of the anime, it was pretty ""meh"" in my opinion. It was nothing too special and did not stand out way too much. I actually preferred bland/plain art style for the characters though 
 
In your average anime, all the characters would usually have hair colors ranging from purple to pink and busts that are pretty much unattainable for the average person in real life. The characters in Amagami SS look and act more realistic while still being very likable. They have normal hair colors (dark hair and some brunettes) and not every other girl is a f-cup. 
 
I usually don't enjoy the type of music on these pure romance animes as much, but for Amagami SS i had to make an exceptions. Both openings,"" I Love"" and Kimi  No Mama De"", were very catchy and soothing. They fit the mood of a happy relationship very well and are now a part of my favorite openings list.  
 
The rest of the sounds in the anime (music/OSTs/voice acting) were also very well done. The music when played would fit the mood, and the characters voice actors would fit their role. The only complaint i have would be the voice for one the heroines, Nakata Sae. It is probably just my personal distaste, but her voice kind of annoyed me. I realize her character is supposed to be shy, but it was just too much for me. The other heroines voice acting were pretty good, but the side characters did voice acting did not seem too stick out too me very much (probably cause their side characters). 
 
Overall, i really enjoyed this anime. The characters are all very likable and you really cant hate on any of them (except the main character for being a lucky a-hole). The arcs, despite being cut off every four episodes, are actually very enjoyable. It might feel a bit rushed at times because of the lack of episodes for each arc, but they still manage to rap things up very well by the time an arcs over.  
 
Even though i really liked it, i still cannot deny that the whole anime is actually pretty generic  (a boy and a girl fall in love and relationship ensues). As a whole, the anime is not something spectacular, but that does not mean it is not fun to watch. It is still a very amusing group of love stories, and i recommend you all to check it out.

    Have you ever felt sorry for a girl that didnt get her chance?Well you dont have to worry here,every girl gets her happy ending. 
 
Story 10/10: 
Story is very simple, but well maybe thats what makes this show show you the magic it does.The protagonist is  afraid of love but soon he realizes that he cant run forever from it,in fact he gladly accepts it when the time comes. 
 
Art 8/10: 
I dont pay too much attention to background art and such,but I didnt find any flaw in this anime art.Its your average anime art with really nice character art and nice environment details. 
 
Character 9/10: 
Characters are simple yet unique. Every one of them is well made,even with some plot twists that I havent seen coming.You easily fall in love with every one of the girls. 
Protagonist  is...well...kind a perv,but his feelings are true also. 
 
Overall 9/10: 
If you are looking for a simple romcom this a perfect anime for you,it will make you smile and reliase that everything is not as it seems.

    Amagami SS is a lighthearted romantic high-school anime with a little bit of humour here and there, telling the story of Junichi Tachibana, who had his heart broken two years ago on Christmas when he got stood up by his date. Therefore, he has a hard time opening up to his feelings and fears that he will have to spend another Christmas alone. Luckily for him, there are plenty of girls in his high school that he will soon get close to. 
 
This anime consisting of twenty-five episodes is divided into story arcs, each leading to a different path for Junichi as he gets involved with different girls. There are six girls in total, each developing a deeper relationship with Junichi over the course of four episodes, after which everything resets and it starts with a different story arc. The last episode is sort of an arc on its own, and it’s mainly there to explain some stuff such as why our hopeless romantic protagonist got stood up two years ago. 
 
Watching Amagami SS can be kind of an unstable experience, as some episodes may be better than others, or even entire story arcs could go right or wrong for each individual viewer. I did enjoy most of it, although there were indeed some ups and downs here and there, and by the end it was pretty obvious to me how I felt about each story arc in particular. As such, I’ll be giving you a closer look into each arc and why exactly I liked or disliked it. This remains, however, my own personal opinion, and I’m sure some may have a different view on the whole thing. Let’s get started now, shall we? 
 
Some minor spoilers ahead. 
 
Haruka Morishima 
 
The first story arc starts in a pretty great way and I have to say that even though I did not expect much going into this anime, I was entirely captivated by the first episode. It was very entertaining and kept things at a casual level, which made it an easy and pleasant experience. Regarding Haruka Morishima, she’s in her final year and is considered one of the most popular girls in Junichi’s high school. Like I said, this story arc had a good start, but over its course I kinda felt more and more turned off by it. First of all, there’s a scene involving a weird fetish that even though is somewhat cute, feels awkward and ultimately throws that entire episode off balance. Then there’s Haruka’s personality – her insensitive manners and the way she treats Junichi at times doesn’t give much credibility to their whole “love story.” Plus, there’s little to no chemistry between them, which makes things even worse. The 10-years-later scene at the end of the arc was a nice little touch, though. 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi 
 
A huge improvement over the first story arc, this one works much better as it features a good sense of progress between the leads’ relationship and some drama over its course keeps things interesting and more emotionally involving. One of Junichi’s childhood friends, Kaoru Tanamachi is in the same class as him and works a part-time job as a waitress. There’s a good sense of development between them as the story goes on and the final episode delivers a satisfying conclusion, even if it feels a little rushed. The chemistry between Junichi and Kaoru is also excellent and their interactions are quite enjoyable, often accompanied by some good laughs. One of the better story arcs of the series, for sure. 
 
Sae Nakata 
 
Next up is Sae Nakata, an underclassman and friend of Miya’s, Junichi’s younger sister. Sae is extremely shy and the reason why Junichi and her end up spending so much time together is because Junichi decides to help her improve her social skills. Do not be surprised if you find her voice to be annoying, which many actually did. For those who enjoy Sae’s personality, this should prove to be a really nice arc, as it does pretty much everything right, including the ending. 
 
Ai Nanasaki 
 
Another friend of Miya’s and around the same age as her and Sae, Ai Nanasaki is part of the school’s swimming team and her first encounter with Junichi leads to her calling him a pervert. Unlike many of the other girls, Ai’s personality is easily likeable and her relationship with Junichi develops in a natural and pleasing way. Unfortunately, there were some weird stuff in this arc as well, including a trip to the amusement park that makes for some odd moments that just don’t fit in this anime. Nevertheless, Ai’s arc is an enjoyable one and has become my favourite, especially due to the well-done ending. 
 
Rihoko Sakurai 
 
Rihoko Sakurai is another childhood friend of Junichi, although their relationship has been minimal over the years and mostly held at a casual level. Most of this arc centers around Rihoko’s battle with her unusually big appetite as she tries to go on a diet. For me, this arc has been by far the least interesting, especially considering that nothing really happens, even in the final episode, as Rihoko and Junichi actually don’t end up being together, although it isn’t out of the question in the long run. 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji 
 
Coincidentally or not, the final story arc is the one I’ve been looking forward to the most, as I found Tsukasa Ayatsuji quite intriguing as the anime progressed. Unfortunately, this one took a surprising turn when it was revealed that Tsuakasa actually had two personalities and her real one was marked by extreme tsundere qualities. Not to say that the arc wasn’t interesting, because it really was, and the ending was satisfying enough, especially since it showed us another “10-years-later” scene, but Tsukasa’s sudden change of personality simply ruined my view of her for the rest of the arc. Still, it’s one of the most well-done arcs in the entire series. 
 
Final episode and closing comments 
 
The final episode features yet another girl, Risa Kamizaki, with her very own little story arc that develops in the last twenty minutes, as well as explaining why Junichi got stoop up on his date two years ago. I was mostly lukewarm towards this episode, although it was somewhat of a nice addition to the end of the series. Risa’s actions, however, made it hard to root for her or even like her, but it seems that Junichi had no problem with that at all. 
 
All in all, Amagami SS turned out to be quite a good anime and made for some really pleasant experiences. I found it to be very addicting to watch, especially since everything develops so fast and new story arcs always make for a breath of fresh air. On a visual level, Amagami SS looks great. The art is very fitting and the animation is very well done. You won’t likely end up calling this one of your favourites, but it’s still a series well worth watching.

    Amagami SS is one of those anime where I couldn’t decide if I should watch it or not. After watching a few episodes, I had to say that it was magnificent. You probably thought that Amagami SS would be cliché and boring, but it is not! It is nothing like your boring beta main character and girls falling for the main character for no reason. One reason that made me hesitate to watch Amagami SS is because it was based off a dating game. I didn’t expect a game to be made into a good anime. What can we expect of Tachibana Junichi? 
 
To start off, the plot is amazing. Each arc is significant in its own way. The staff made it that you can see what is happening to other female protagonists in each arc. It is pretty unique since each arc is another parallel universe. For me, if you mention a character, you would have to show some interactions between the main characters. It is odd to just leave a character that was highlighted. Each arc has a unique approach. For an example, some may have unique narration; some may even have unique concepts. You may think that the girls are somewhat going to fall for him in a cliché way, but I guarantee you that it is not cliché. You know that childhood friend trend? Well bet your ass that they made the childhood friend win and make it look good. I wished I could have explained the arcs, but then it would be long. The arcs can be related in real life and have some unique foreshadowing. The romance is great throughout the anime. I believe this is one of my favorite since it is kept short and organized. As of now, I can't really watch anime with romance that takes more than 10 episodes to develop a relationship. I'm not saying that they're bad, but I want to know more. There is also drama which I felt put a unique feeling in the anime. The dramatic approach is good in certain aspect and Amagami SS played it out well. 
 
Besides the plot, the character development is amazing. An example of this would be a shy girl and a boy. Having a shy girl in an anime is difficult to build up plot and development since the girl is obviously shy. Amagami SS took a nice approach to this and was able to tie the knots. Each girl has their own insight. Since this is based off a dating game, it would be pretty awkward to have girls with similar personality and approaches. The flags that were raised were smart and were implemented perfectly. I guess you can say that Junichi is quite smooth. Throughout Amagami SS, Junichi is a great character. Being heartbroken is one of the worst feelings anybody can have. Especially if you were waiting for your date on Christmas Eve yet that person doesn’t show up. If that happened to me, I would never open my heart to anyone. Due to that, Junichi has a unique way to build up his character in each arc. Another thing I like about Amagami SS is that the staff didn’t make him change drastically (out of the ordinary change that doesn’t match his character).  
 
The audio is amazing. It is very detailed. An example of this is when there is a scene in a classroom full of classmates; you can hear other people talk. This is important because it describes the scene and brings light to it. The OST is well put in the anime. The music is amazing and it highlights certain scenes. It is nice to hear soothing music along with a nice scenario. What I favor the most in music is piano and they did have beautiful piano plays.  Music and cinematic plays an important role in shows. The opening is one of my favorite. The lyrics are catchy and the animation for it is good. The translation of the lyrics is quite good for a love song. Another great part is that each arc ending is sung by the main female protagonist. It is just like Bakemonogatari. The lyrics for the ending are well put and it describes the feelings of the female protagonist who sung it.  
 
The art style is good for 2010. I believe this anime has more focus on the plot and audio rather than the art. The art style is not bad, yet it is not superior. Amagami SS is made in 2010 so I can’t argue and compare it to modern anime (2012~2013). I take art very seriously and I can’t watch anime with badly drawn characters or bad coloring. I can say that the art was still beautiful in certain ways. If I have seen Amagami SS when it was airing and compared it to the airing anime, it would be near the top. Besides the art, we have the animation. The animation is pretty good. There are beautiful events where I feel that are touching. There were great camera angles and such. The animations are detailed along with the background and such. Overall, it is clean and does not look like a potato for sure. 
 
Finally, we have reached the conclusion. I felt like I should have explained the arc in this review, but then again it would have been too long. I already had explained three arcs, but then I decided to erase them because then it would feel like I’m writing my opinions with relation to life. There is nothing wrong about writing my opinion as it is for a review, but then I want to hit the point to why Amagami SS is a great anime and add my points. The romance is surely amazing. I guess nice guys don't always fail. I’ve enjoyed writing this review just as much as I’ve enjoyed watching Amagami SS. I’m really happy that there is a sequel, but I had to stop and take my time to write this review. If you found reading this review interesting and good, you would definitely enjoy watching Amagami SS (vice versa).

    What the fuck have I just watched... Honestly, no fucking clue.  
 
Shit was a rollercoaster ride... but like one of those kids ones. Didn't quite get the adrenaline going... but got you at least a little excited.  
 
I'm sat here in my 20s, watching how lucky this high school cunt is. Gonna be honest, reminds me of me when I was 13... I peaked at that age. Disappointing, I know. And here I am on my limited Christmas leave sinking hours into this ... erm... thing? Can't Quite call it trash as it's not that level, but I'm not sure if I could call it decent either. Its filling the very gap that I can't... My arseho- no, wait... wrong one... It's filling a depressingly self aware void that I think most of us failures have. That need to watch something wholesome and think ""Yeah, that guy gets puss, unlike me"". All in all, i honestly sort of enjoyed this not trashfest.'Tis all, I guess 
 
Summed Up, I enjoyed it, I managed it in 2 sittings, 16 eps and 10 eps. It helped my avoid doing urgent work that is critical to me keeping my job.  
 
Cheers Amagami, hope you were worth it.

    A story where a young man who heart was broken on Christmas Eve. He has one more chance to find love with six candidates. 
 
I only watched the first episode. 
 
Based on the dating game, I follows the usual dating sim anime adapation style. But what I see is much different. There will be an arc of episodes on when the main guy chooses one girl. Different girl, different arc. A interesting use especially when the girls have a lot of potential of being the girlfriend.  
 
I could say they should've used this on the other adaptations. 
 
Voice acting is very nice, and the character variety makes it a good reason for the multiple arcs. Seriously, a guy can only choose one girl. 
 
So far this anime, looks enjoyable and hopefully won't disappoint.

    First of, I never played the game so this review is based completely on the episodes I've seen so far, and I might have a different view of this series after seeing all of it. With that in mind: 
 
Story:  
Typical harem-like story, with an even more typical boy who's awkward, shy, and has some, if not a lot of trouble trying to go out with the girls that clearly have interest with him.   
 
The plot progression is different, though in my opinion not the best, especially if this anime is going to be short. The anime is subdivided into different groups in which has a certain amount of chapters; these groups are the different women that the main character encounters.  Though sounds like a good idea, it's really not.  That, in my opinion, disrupts the flow of the overall plot progression. 
 
 
Art: 
Average.  The lines are soft, and the colors aren't too vibrant, nor dull.  The characters' faces remind me of the Gate Keepers (a fairly old anime)  without the hollow eye look.   
 
 
Sound: 
The BGM I think is well executed; it's not overbearing to the situation, while still being there to help with the mood. I like it like that: subtle. 
 
 
Character: 
Hmmmm...  Sometimes I REALLY REALLY want to smack Junichi due to his incompetence; but then again, if he was outspoken, it'd be just like a reality series.  Although at rare times, he does give out some good game on the ladies, and I like that because he does that in unexpected instances.  
 
Tsusaka to me is an airhead.  Seriously, comparing a boy that likes you to a dog? Out of nowhere, jump on him for no reason?  As much as she's popular, she needs to be a bit more mature than she is. Her popularity must have inflated her head a little bit.  
 
As for the other characters, some have been introduced, but not fully developed, or have not been introduced at all.  I'll let you, the reader decide on what to say for the later ones.  
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Somehow, it feels a bit like a slice of life too me, but that's all well and good. It's a good anime if you want to have an occasional laugh from either super cheesy lines, or random occurrences.  Hell, it helped me relax after work.   
 
 
Overall: 
It's a fairly good anime, though of course its genre is one of the most overused genres in anime, even in the broadcasting industry, but hey, it works.  I don't see it having a big potential though.  It's just one of those animes that's there if you wan to see it.

    There’s a lot of visual novels (at least this is what I think it is) being made into anime these days a lot of them around this time seem a bit disappointing but Amagami SS does not disappoint 
 
Plot: The story starts of with the main protagonist Junichi Tachibana who gets his heart broken when his date doesn’t show up during Christmas Eve.  Fast forward two years and Junichi is just a regular second year in high school.  This anime is in an omnibus format so each character would get there own arc, so I’m going to review every arc. 
 
Haruka Morishima (8.5/10) - At the beginning of this arc our protagonist, Junichi Tachibana falls for a senior named Haruka Morishima.  These two become friends and Junichi manages to muster up the courage to confess to her, only to be rejected.  However this doesn’t stop him, these two become closer and Junichi tries again, he gets rejected again but it appears to go better this time.  Haruka and Junichi then spend Christmas together and we are served a very emotional and romantic ending.  This arc is really enjoyable although it felt slightly rushed (due to the omnibus format).  I could really feel the development; it didn’t seem forced at all. Not to mention it was fun watching this couple. The ending was really well executed, it was emotional, romantic and it really moving, I haven’t seen an ending this well done in a long time.  This arc did have one or two problems and sometimes the development felt sort of unnatural but overall this arc was just wonderful. 
 
As for her character, I really liked her because she is very unique and is not like the average girl you see in a series.  She has a cheerful personality, likes cute things and is very weird.  I really like Haruka because she is different and because she is just so loveable. 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi (8/10) – This arc starts off with the 2 bad friends doing their usual thing with Kaoru usually teasing Junichi.  Kaoru is then faced with problems and starts skipping school because of it.  Soon after, Junichi can’t stop thinking of her as a result of this.  He then sees her at work and she tells him what is happening and Junichi manages to comfort her and help her resolve the situation.  They then go on a date during Christmas, where a really romantic ending happens.  In a lot of ways this arc is different from the last arc and that doesn’t mean its worse.  The feelings in this arc felt more natural than the last one although I didn’t feel as much development in this arc.  Much like the last arc it was watching it.  The ending didn’t have as much as an impact on me but it wasn’t bad by any means.  The arc did feel like it slightly too little development (just slightly) and the ending wasn’t as good but this arc was great as well. 
 
Kaoru has a really cool personality and she seems like someone I would like to be friends with.  I really liked her; she’s not as unique as Haruka but just because she’s not unique doesn’t mean she’s not a good character.  She’s a likeable character with her fair share of qualities and really that’s all you can really ask for. 
 
Sae Nakata (7/10) – This arc begins in the summer with Junichi meeting Sae when she returns his coin purse that he dropped earlier.  Soon after that he discovers that Sae wants to get a job but she is too shy to do so, so Junichi decides to train her.  They spend more time together and the more time they spend together, the closer they got and eventually they fall for each other.  After Sae gets the job they decide to enter their school’s best couple contest at the Christmas festival. After winning second place they use their prize which was watching a movie in some VIP seating.  Here is where the romantic ending takes place.  Through-out the arc there is also a narrator who makes sarcastic remarks.  I had one big problem with this arc and that was the narrator, he was more annoying than funny.  There was a decent amount of development and romance in this arc but because of the narrator, there were some parts I couldn’t take seriously.  The ending was well done and although it wasn’t as good as Haruka’s ending it was still well done.  The narrator actually hurt this arc more than help it but overall it was still good because the amount of development in they put in this arc was satisfying. 
 
Sae is the shy character, she does seem a bit generic but I have no problem with that because she still has qualities and she’s cute too.  However nothing really stood out to me about her and her voice does get annoying but it’s not that bad it makes your ears bleed.  Not a great character but she’s not a bad one either 
 
Ai Nanasaki (8.5/10) - The arc starts when Junichi coincidentally meets Ai at the park where she teases Junichi.  After this they keep meeting up coincidentally and become friends.  Junichi then helps Ai with a lot of her problems, such as math and her brother.  As the story progresses Ai starts to have feelings for Junichi.  However later Ai is faced with tragic news but Junichi manages to comfort her.  After the Christmas festival, Ai take Junichi to her secret spot and a really emotional and romantic ending takes place.  This arc is also different from the rest, as it is filled with emotion and has more development than the other arcs.  The ending was also really moving and I think it was a beautiful way to end the arc.  Also it wasn’t only the ending that had a climatic feel to it.  However this arc was a bit too fast paced which resulted in half of the last episode being filler.  Other than that though, this arc was marvellous. 
 
I really liked Ai.  For some reason I just attached to her I don’t know why but I did.  I guess it’s because of her personality and also because it’s one of those people you’d hate to see suffer.    She had a lot of qualities and she was pretty cute too.  I don’t know why but I just felt attached to her when I was watching this arc. 
 
Rihoko Sakurai (6/10) – This arc starts off a bit different, with Rihoko already loving Junichi.  As the school year goes on, their friends realize this and try to get Rihoko and Junichi together, which has little success. Also Rihoko decides to go on another diet which Junichi says that he will cheer her on.  However the 2 of tea club members graduate next year and Rihoko is tasked with finding new members and Junichi decides to help.  Junichi and Rihoko go to more places together and when graduation day comes near we are given an ending.  Well this arc definitely went for something different but I don’t think it worked.  I wouldn’t say the arc was bad but why fix something that wasn’t broken.  There is no romantic development which made this arc feel slow and make me feel like nothing was happening.  It felt like I was sometimes forcing myself through this arc.  In the end I felt very unsatisfied and I was disappointed to say the least.  I’ll give it credit for going for something different but at the end of the day I don’t think they should’ve done it 
 
Now Rihoko wasn’t a bad character, she had her fair share of qualities too.  She’s innocent and most of the time she’s happy.  Also she doesn’t have the super model body that most anime girls seem to have.  Overall I think she’s good character 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji (9/10) – This arc starts off with the beginning of the preparations of the Christmas festival and Junichi surprisingly volunteers to help out. However somewhere along the way Junichi finds out the kind of person Tsukasa really is.  As we go on the two become closer but somewhere along the way Tsukasa changes.  Junichi then ponders upon this but he manages to resolve it.  We are then given a beautiful ending.  Wow, after watching this arc I was left speechless.  Although during the middle it did seem like this arc was confusing but it all tied together in the end.  This, I think was actually the deepest arc, because while the others were straight forward for the most part this arc had a deeper meaning behind it.  The ending was just the icing on a beautiful cake and although this arc did leave some questions unanswered, this arc was just fantastic.  This arc had enough romantic to satisfy me as well 
 
Tsukasa is also very well done.  I love how she doesn’t show her real self to others, only showing it to Junichi.  Of course both sides of Tsukasa are wonderful and likable. Her character is really well done as well. 
 
 
As for Junichi he seems to change with every arc, but he’s perverted in every one of them.  He’s also somewhat weird but I don’t have a problem with him and overall is an okay protagonist. 
There’s a bunch of other side characters that I don’t want to get into and I don’t think any of them are really worth mentioning except for Miya. 
 
Art (7/10): The artwork was pretty average and there was hardly anything redeeming about it.  It wasn’t bad but at the same time it didn’t wow me either. 
 
Sound (8/10): The opening and endings were both very good.  I liked some endings better than others but overall they were all very good.   The VAs also did alright voicing the characters.  No real complains here 
 
Enjoyment (9/10):  I really did enjoy Amagami SS; I was always motivated to watch it.  Also I like how they did an omnibus format so I can see romance with every girl.  It had it highlights and lowlights but I really enjoyed watching this series 
 
Overall:  Amagami SS probably worth a try if you like romance and also since it’s in an omnibus format very little will be mad that the protagonist didn’t pick a certain girl.  Most visual novel adaptions’(I hope I’m right that it’s a visual novel) these days don’t seem to be all too good but Amagami SS is an exception.  Overall I really good series to pick up. Thanks for Reading

    This is my first legitimate review, so please bare with me. Ok, let's get on with the review. 
 
Amagami SS isn't your typical visual novel adaptation. Unlike other adaptations, such as the Key VNs (Kanon, Air, Clannad) or the TYPE-MOON works (Fate, Tsukihime), this follows an omnibus format. For those that don't know what that means, it's basically several different arcs told separately, with each arc reseting after the final episode. This, in turn, gives Amagami an interesting experience. 
 
Due to the omnibus format, each arc is treated differently. The personalities of characters, storytelling, and even pacing are different; which makes it feel as if you're watching a different series each arc. I personally enjoyed the format since it was more focused on each of the heroines in the VN. 
 
Story (9): 
The story follows the typical boy-meets-girl and they fall in love type of story. What makes Amagami SS stand out from the typical is the approach of each heroine. Due to their different personalities, each arc presents you with a different type of approach. Each story arc was able to be fleshed out due to the focus on each character and their side characters. It caused less interference with the storyline itself. 
 
Art (7): 
Probably one of the less impressive aspects of the series. The art seems fairly generic. You have the girl with long hair, the girl with short hair, the guy with hair swiped to the side. Typical anime features to say the least. Although, what did catch me was the hair colors for each character. There weren't any crazy, unrealistic colors, so that gets a plus. The environment was alright. You have your school, home, park, beach, restaurant. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It isn't as impressive as (insert anime series by impressive studio here), but it's passable. 
 
Sound (8): 
The seiyuus chosen for most of the characters seemed to match the way I interpreted them. However, I did have one problem with one of the heroines, which I will not mention in this review (you'll probably know who I'm talking about). Background music was pretty good as well. It fit each of the scenes well enough that it didn't seem forced. Silly was silly, serious was serious. 
 
Character (8): 
Most of the characters, mainly the heroines, can be put under each of the archetypes for characters. However, the main character, Junichi, goes through some pretty interesting personality changes between each arc. If you didn't know the series was in an omnibus format, you'd think he was bipolar or suffered from a personality disorder or something. Side characters can be seen in one arc, and almost completely disappear in the next one. That was somewhat disappointing, since I thought there were some side characters that seemed more interesting than the mains. 
 
Enjoyment (9): 
For people looking for an interesting experience, this is your series. The different arcs provide a variety of stories. It's as if you were watching a different series each arc, which I thought was a huge plus. 
 
Overall (9): 
I have to say, at first I thought I wouldn't enjoy the series. The pacing would feel odd with only four episodes for each heroine (and only one for a special heroine!), but I was surprised how well the pacing of each arc felt. Although some arcs felt rushed, it was pretty understandable. Sometimes I even yearned for more story since I liked the arc so much. The omnibus format also helped the anime series get this rating from me. For me, each arc could be considered a different genre (Drama, comedy, etc.). It created quite the ride. And now, in the end, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and am sad that it is over. Goodbye Amagami SS.

    I like the guy. He is not chickening out the time he has to something to say. He has a goal, he goes for it.  No 5 minutes of blushing combined with anos, etos and sonos, where in the end someone barges right in and spoils all the fun. 
 
The other characters are not stupid either. And there are no stupid misunderstandings, led by ""just happened to pass by and see the most embarrassing moment"" kind of things, so this is no love comedy. 
 
The art is a bit different from what I've seen recently, so it took me a while to get used to it. But no complains. And it seemed to me that it got better in the second episode. 
 
The sound is nice and the music is not getting in the way as in some animes. Voices and characters match well. 
 
OP and ED are lame though. Not worth watching every time, even when the songs are not that bad. However, what does ""I love you forever with you"" actually mean?

    'Amagami SS' is based on galge (non-hentai dating-sim) 'Amagami'. The title means ""light bite"", which probably describes the playfulness and cuteness of the heroines (half of them do bite or get bitten). ""SS"" is believed to stand for ""Short Stories"". It is the most comprehensive and game-like anime I have ever seen that's based on a dating-sim. 
 
 
STORY: 
'Amagami SS' is made up of 7 short stories where the protagonist goes after a different girl each time. The heroines are made up of the most common archetypes for galge or moe anime. The reason I say this series is the most comprehensive, however, is because there's a wide spectrum of heroines and the protagonist's personality also changes depending on who he's going after. What we have here is not just an average indecisive main character in a harem, we get to see all kinds of personality match ups, and it's more realistic because we behave differently in front of different people, especially in romantic relationships. In addition, there were all sorts of hentai fetishes and endings for each arc. I will touch on this subject little more in the Character section, but I really liked this about 'Amagami SS' because it's harder to get tired of the story even if same events are repeated 7 times. 
 
Another thing that really struck me was how watching this series really felt like playing a galge. There's been plenty of galge/eroge anime adaptations before, but most of them seemed to follow a single route or one combined route. Every such series I have seen so far gave me a sense of a set story. Boy meets girl(s), everyone fall for him, but eventually he ends up with ""girl A"" over all other girls, or unable to choose for the indecisiveness. In 'Amagami SS', we know exactly who we're going after like picking a route in advance, and then protagonist come in contact with the heroine like every other series. But here, they clearly spell out the possible options; the protagonist frequently think to himself ""should I do this or that?"" or another character asks ""are you coming or not?"". While this may be considered poor scriptwriting, it gives us a sense that the main character is actually making a choice himself rather than fate or where the wind takes him. It actually feels like he's consciously making decisions to win over a girl, just like how a player should in the game. Sometimes it's the girl trying to win him over too. 
 
The final episode also explains why the other girls back off when he goes after a particular girl (assuming it's when Risa gives up). 
 
 
CHARACTER: 
One of the better harem protagonist around. There are moments when he gets reluctant or miss the signals, but he is not nearly indecisive nor thickheaded as our typical anime main character. He actually goes after the girls most of the time, and confess his love every single time. In rare occasions when the girls are chasing after him, he notices the girl's unnatural behavior. The girls are still more interesting in him than they should be, but it's far more tolerable because he worked for all of their attention. He also has just the right amount of perversity, which gave us viewers the right amount of fan service, and had relatively rational motives. 
 
The heroines are very diverse, each with a distinct personality and status. The main character behaves differently to win them over, and indulges in all sorts of fetishes in the process. 
 
To summarize each arc, [Name]: [Personality type (Translation)] [Status] - [Fetish] 
 
Morishima Haruka: Nonki (Carefree) Princess - Behind the knee 
Tanamachi Kaoru: Yancha (Boyish) Girl Buddy - Bellybutton 
Nakata Sae: Uchiki (Shy) Kouhai - Student/instructor play, maid play, loli 
Nanasaki Ai: Cool (Composed) Athlete - Flat chest, cosplay 
Sakurai Rihiko: Tennen (Airheaded) Childhood Friend - Huge boobs 
Ayatsuji Tsukasa: Seijun (Pure/Innocent) Valedictorian - Trapped in room 
Kamizaki Risa: Osekkai (Nosy) Stalker - None 
 
...Who are we kidding? 
Ayatsuji Tsukasa: Tsundere Slave Queen - Masochist play 
 
All the girls are not as dumb as typical harem heroines, and behaved rationally with exception of Ayatsuji. There's at least 1 girl that suites your taste no matter what kind of girls you're into. 
 
Character developments are poor and love triangle didn't exist, but for the purpose of galge anime adaptation, their cameo-like appearances were very appropriate since they didn't detract from the main story. 
 
 
ART: 
All the girls are cute and pretty as they should be, very visually pleasing. Backgrounds are decent. Nothing particularly impressive about it, but tried and tested style that projects the peaceful high school life atmosphere. There were also couple of scenes with great composition and camera movements. 
 
 
SOUND: 
With exception to Konno Hiromi (Sae), everyone sounded like they should. She is a shy character, but the strained high-pitch voice was just too annoying. Itou Shizuka (Haruka) and Satou Rina (Kaoru) were solid as usual. 
 
BGM is rather ordinary, but fits the romantic scenes pretty well. 
 
OP1 'i Love' by azusa was an extremely strong theme song for a seishun series like this, and the OP animation had a nice flow that introduced the heroines well and represented their personality well with their signature poses. 
OP2 and EDs were above average as well, and appropriate. 
ED3 is a soft song that makes us reflect on all the girls conquered before. 
 
 
OVERALL: 
'Amagami SS' is a rather conservative seishun (coming of age romance) series that was wonderfully executed. Although things go a bit too well for the protagonist and character development was limited, it depicted the flushing, awkward, and bittersweet high school romance very well. A great simple heartwarming romance anime. 
 
The comedy series was also pretty funny without being distracting to the romance, and came off very naturally. It was a very solid series all around that I enjoyed a lot more than I expected from a galge adaptation.

    A countless number of visual novel to anime adaptations have seen the light of day and it takes no genius to figure out the trend in story-telling. Divide the show into a series of character arcs, whilst following an over-arching story/plot; or just follow a single character arc and be done with it. This has proven to be quite an effective method for telling these kinds of stories but it's not ideal for pleasing all the character's fans. Now in comes Amagami SS, a series that takes a step in a new direction by telling each of the character's stories, as a 4 episode standalone arc. 
 
Amagami SS basically has every arc begin the same, by introducing our protagonist Junichi Tachibana, who's suffering from some form of PTSD, after being stood up on Christmas eve sometime ago (I know, it's pretty pathetic... just roll with it). Stuff happens and then it wraps it up, in pretty much the same way for every single arc. So yeah, there's really not much to say about the story, well stories, since they all follow a distinct pattern that's easy to pick up on. Boy meets girl, boy & girl bond through some arbitrary activity, mutual romantic feelings develop and well you catch my drift. Sure each character arc provides a fairly different story from the last, yet it's difficult shake off the feeling that you've just seen this story but with some differences. So by the end I really couldn't find pleasure when Boy A finally got together with Girl B, when he also hooked up with Girl A,C,D,E & F. 
 
Speaking of the girls, they are just about the best thing about the series and the director & writers did a good job in combating the obvious favouritism we are used to in harems by developing each of the girls equally. My only gripe with this method is that even the characters I didn't care about we're also developed. As for the male protagonist, he's just what you expect from your average high school boy who sneaks off with his friend to enjoy the odd dirty magazine. Although the creator tried adding some subtle quirks for each individual character arc. Some of these quirks work but others don't. Like hiding in the closet (that's just waiting for a joke). 
 
I've heard a lot of praise regarding the art and animation of Amagami SS and sure I must admit that the character designs are great. With character's looking like people you expect to meet in real life, doing away with the annoying multi-coloured hairstyles that plagues this genre. But apart from that the animation is just above average. All one has to do is pay attention to the background. As for the sound design, there's really nothing remarkable about it; the same seiyuus we anime veterans are all used, working well with the roles they are given and completed with some typical light-hearted melodies. Like I said... nothing remarkable. 
 
All in all, Amagami SS is a collection of 6 run-of-the-mill highschool romance stories and with 6 stories/girls to choose from you're bound to like at least 1 of the stories/girls. So I'll give the show credit for allowing me to enjoy multiple romantic short stories. Did I enjoy them all? No, but I enjoyed enough... sort of. The good thing is that the obvious fanservice tropes, like pantyshots & breast jiggles are kept to moderate levels throughout but that's because the very nature of this anime is fanservice. That in itself made the show watchable for me however it doesn't excuse the unfunny humour the show is filled with and fact that it became a repeatable conquest, like with every visual novel on the market. Some may take pleasure in what Amagami SS has to offer, I cannot refute that, but I didn't. So you can accept what I've written about Amagami SS, or take it with a grain of salt, but either way I'm sure you did not click on this review assuming that I wholeheartedly liked the show now did you?

    I've watched plenty of romance animes in my lifetime, and normally I don't write my reviews for them. But this anime makes me hate so much. 
 
After watching 2 episodes, this anime is slowly becoming unbearable 
 
What makes it truly annoying and irritable are the retarded motives and ideas. 
 
What gets me to the core is that the male lead is deeply traumatized by some stupid past event: being stood up on a middle school date on Christmas Eve. Ok big deal, but now the lead is a completely depressed cynic of love and lives some depressing life. He further randomly believes that the cure for his broken heart is to fall for the valedictorian of the school.  
 
Epic Retard! 
 
Furthurmore, he confesses shortly after just meeting such a person, without any development because he is infatuated by her ""great personality and beauty"", but the lead and story wants you to be believe its true love. The next episode develops a bit more, I'm pleased. But once again, the hollow actions irritate me. 
 
SPOILERS== 
examples to support my claim:(ep2) after being denied the pool, and the scene takes place in the hallway, the lead RANDOMLY, out of thin air, spontaneously says ""Let's go look up cute things in the library"" WTF?! This major statement, not only has no previous motives or ideas to show why he said this, leads to a big scene later on. But what on Earth made him want to say that?! WHY?! 
 
when she falls asleep in the library (or even the nurse bed scene), the lead just waits and watches. It is assumed that this DOESN'T make him a creeper and girl takes it as gentle hospitality. I also don't understand why the lead waits for hours (sunset) and not wake her up in the library? What?! Then on top of being awkward (in both scenes), he confesses yet again. WHY?! What is he thinking? Neither of them have any common sense! It's unbearably stupid. 
 
In short: within 2 episodes, the confused, awkward lead, who can talk to any other girl normally except his crush, confesses to her twice because she is the one who can save him from his great depression.  
SPOILERS== 
 
I realize some may like this anime because it portrays a nonrealistic point of view of how love is perceived and obtained. Thats why I gave it a medium score (on top of only 2 episodes to judge with). But for those who value reality, I'm advising you to avoid this anime. Theres no meaning behind actions done and common sense does not exist in this anime. It fails unbelievably at showing why characters do what they do. It feels so fake and so awkward. 
 
on a side note: all the lead's thoughts are about how to get the girl and NOT actually about the girl. its really just emphasizing how its infatuation and not love. All the male lead wants are kisses. KISSES. Nothing to do with her personality, no motives to show why he likes her to begin with, he just want kisses. STUPID 
 
EDIT(After watching first half of episode 3) 
This anime; I have dropped. It has gone beyond stupidty. 
This anime from the beginning has thrown me left and right. And ep3 takes the flippin' cake. Even though the male and female lead aren't even in a slightest of a relationship, they get downright kinky and awkward by letting kissing become acceptable without being in a relationship. They take the act of kissing, something that is the ultimate climax of any romance anime into some worthless, shameless act. They derogatize the meaning of a kiss as the male lead randomly (once again, leaving you wondering why the heck did he say that) to be kissed on the eyebrow multiple times. The girl rejects flatly, but the atmosphere is not at all awkward for them and she compensates by letting him get kissed BEHIND THE KNEE? What is going on? Forget it when I said theres a lack of common sense earlier. Common Sense has been REMOVED from this anime. Nothing is logical, everything is awkward for YOU but not for the characters. I'm dropping this anime, this isn't romance, this is stupidity. This cannot be correlated in anyway to ANY real life situation and if one were to follow such actions, he or she  will not achieve such ""positive"" results.  
 
I do realize some people enjoy the fictitious romance animes and I'll attempt to respect that, but this is more than I can handle.  
 
 
IN SHORT: The anime is stupid. It takes the bubbly love romance-comedy drama stuff and replaces it with awkward, unrealistic scenes with wrong outcomes powered by untold motives (if there is any). it makes it seem as if the MOST HOPELESS GUY on the planet can get a girl. Get real.

    Amagami SS in short is probably the best adaption of a dating sim that stays true to its roots while feeling like it was from a collection of stories rather than a game. Each arc is wonderful to watch and fulfills the story for the viewer, in the end even actually expanding on it. 
 
Story: 10/10 It is in omnibus format meaning that the stories may contain the same characters but every four episodes they ""reset"" and focus on another aspect (in this case a girl) and expand the story on these ""what if"" moments. Overall very enjoyable each arc had it's differences and no two arcs were alike. The only similarity is the relationship building and character placing  that occurred. That being said, each arc feels unique and enjoyable. 
 
Art: 8/10 Amagami SS isn't the greatest anime in terms of art I have seen, but in no means does it try to be that. The character movements are fluid and what you would expect from art style today, neither amazing or bad.  
 
Sound: 10/10 The OP's this series contains are among my favorite openings I have encountered while watching anime, as well as each ending theme for each girls arc is performed by the voice actress which I just found incredible. A few of the endings are so catchy I can play them on repeat even.  In terms of the sound quality during the anime it is what you would expect from this type of show, however in some scenes the background sounds and music just make the experience much more enjoyable than most Anime I have seen. And to make an example, don't worry not a spoiler, but during a scene the sounds of the voices actually echo to show how empty/large the room actually is I haven't been that impressed for a while. (I know it's sad) 
 
Characters: 10/10 The 6 girls are all incredible in their own ways while the male lead isn't a terrible guy either, he is actually rather likable, indecisive occasionally but firm in what he thinks and should do most of the time. As for the girls they each have unique personalities and are all interesting in their own way.  I will explain the girls below in the order that their arcs came. 
 
Haruka Morishima: The school idol, very outgoing and caring as well as has an overall incredible personality. (My personal favorite) 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi: The tomboyish but feminine in a sense long time friend, very funny as well.  
 
Sae Nakata: The very shy, reserved, quiet girl. Not much to say other than her voice may be perceived as annoying. (I personally do think so too. But it doesn't take away from the arc) 
 
Ai Nanasaki: An underclassman on the swim team, seems cold at first but warms up to MC, great personality not afraid to say what she thinks. 
 
Rihoko Sakurai: The childhood friend, she is gentle and caring as well as somewhat ditzy at sometimes, great character as well. (Will need to watch second season for more development if this is your favorite character.) 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji: Definitely the most interesting arc as well as character, being the Class Rep and a perfectionist with a few twists and turns along the way. This arc is a must watch, the character development in four episodes is amazing, I can't say enough. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 This will probably stay my favorite anime of all time I can't express enough of how much I enjoyed this series as a whole and how it stayed so true to form and how so much development of the characters could be done in four episodes while some take at least 3x that amount to get somewhere in romance. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
 
tl;dr Just watch it, all of it. Just once. 
 
Cheers!

    ""That was Christmas Eve, two years ago. She never showed up to the date."" - Junichi Tachibana, Episode 1 
No no, that's not what the story is all about. Sorry to scare you about a what you thought was a spoiler. 
 
Amagami SS hit every note correctly. As a fan of romance, it was a very, very, enjoyable series. 
 
Story: You have Tachibana Junichi. He has a calm and kind personality, and can be a pervert sometimes with his friend Masayoshi Umehara. As quoting above, he was stood up two years ago on Christmas Eve. That event derailed his happiness ever since. It affected him so much that he even made his closet into his bedroom. Present time, he now looks to overcome it. He starts to take interest in a popular senior at school named Haruka Morishima. She eventually makes Junichi her ""pet"" letting him carry her stuff. He then thinks it's a good opportunity to confess. He does, but all the hope he had in a relationship quickly shattered a couple seconds later. ""I prefer someone who's reliable and older than me."" (Haruka Morishima, Episode 1). Well, back to old ways now, right? Wrong. Junichi decides that he will keep trying. 
 
Well that's a preview of Amagami SS for you. I can write so much more, but I will try to keep it short and sweet for now. The story is set into multiple arcs, in omnibus format, meaning that these arcs do not happen in the same timeline, and happens in alternate universes. Also, as you can see from the above, the story is really entertaining. Some people will walk away from this anime saying it's cliche and all, but there's not that much cliche to begin with, or it could be that I was too busy enjoying this series. 
Rating: 9 
 
Character: Character development is a must for a good romance, and Amagami does it right. Different arcs mean multiple girls. Actually, you have 6 different ones to choose from. The popular and fan favorite Morishima Haruka, the childhood friend Tanamachi Kaoru, the shy and cute Nakata Sae, the other childhood friend Sakurai Rihoko, Miya (Junichi's sister)'s friend Nanasaki Ai, and Class-rep Ayatsuji Tsukasa.  They all have different traits, which makes each arc very unique and entertaining to watch. I gave it a 9 for reasons withheld, if you finish the series, you'll probably agree with me. 
Rating: 9 
 
Art: The artwork is just crisp and clear, and the art makes the characters look very nice. No, I'm not talking about Morishima Haruka in her Santa costume, well, you can Google it and judge the art by the pictures, but in general, it looks really nice. I wouldn't say it's identical to Kimi ni Todoke, but it's similar in terms of it's clarity in the art. 
Rating: 9 
 
Sound: I have the OST, why? Because it's one of the OSTs that I enjoy listening to. The background music fits really well with what's happening in the anime, whether it'd be Junichi depressed in his closet again, or it could be the first time meeting someone. The OPs, I Love and Kimi no Mama de are one of the most catchiest songs I have heard in an anime. The EDs feature the main girl of the arc singing their own song. I can't recall if there were multiple insert songs, but there was one insert song that I couldn't stop listening to. Anyways, the sound and music were just beautifully organized for Amagami. It made everything natural and added the atmosphere to your viewing experience. 
Rating: 10 
 
Enjoyment: Amagami SS was a really enjoyable series to me, and probably one of my favorite romance anime out there. It combines well-done romance, with a generous portion of comedy. If this were a game (which it is), then the replay value would be very high, and it'd be a really good game as well. Before I go, some final words: If you're starting into the Romance genre, or a fan of Romance, or even just into comedy, give this series a chance.

    ""Nii nii~~"" 
""Nii nii no baka"" - Miya Tachibana 
 
To put it simply, the combination of each of the heroines to the main protagonist is like a fireworks show. All of them are pretty. 
 
 
The Story: 9/10 
-------------------- 
The story starts with our main male protagonist Junichi Tachibana being stood up on a Christmas Eve date which occurred two years ago. Having a hard time warming up to others, he does not have a girlfriend. In the seven arcs which comprises of four episodes each,(except for Risa Kamizaki who is given one episode) each arc is given one main heroine girl in which Junichi is their personal love interest. Each arc is set in a parallel universe, so the jumps from arc to arc do not follow up. Each arc is unique in itself. Not only are you given a different girl for each arc, but the circumstances and problems encountered are all different for each girl. This brings a little more flavor to the anime rather than being around the same issue. The only thing that affects the main story line that isn't changed in each arc is the fact that Junichi was stood up, so each arc starts from the same point as all the other arcs do with the characters being in the same relationship with Tachibana each time unless it is the heroine girl. The pacing of the story is about the same in each arc, but there would be times where you’d have little segments from the past being put in and the switches are noticeable so don’t worry with not being able to keep up. Each of the arcs endings are very satisfying. 
 
The Art: 9/10 
--------------- 
The art in Amagami SS was fluent and definitely consistent. The art style was about the same for each character, though their physical appearance may look quite different the outlines are still the same - it doesn’t become annoying though. The color shading was very neat and precise, the backgrounds astonishing. There were some sweet lake scenes where you could really appreciate the art. Color overall in the anime went very well with the atmosphere created by the main girl's emotion. There were times where the background would blur a little bit but you rarely take much notice of it. The art was not up to the particular par of Kyoto Animation (known for Clannad) but was very watchable for an anime aired in 2010. Overall the art was very fitting for the story in Amagami. The use of colour at different angles makes each scene enticing and memorable.  
 
The Sound: 10/10 
--------------------- 
Sound in Amagami SS was very crisp and clear. The OP, 'I Love' is an immensely addicting song for a romance anime. The EDs were sung well, and one thing to note is that each main heroine sings her own version of the closing song.  The voice acting here was very smooth. Each of the main girls’ voice suited the type of appearance and personality they had. Another thing to note is that Amagami SS does not come in a dubbed form- for all those dubbed watchers out there-, from what I have searched. There might be a couple of fan dubs but it is doubted they’ll be any better than subbed. 
 
The Characters: 9/10 
-------------------------- 
The characters were all unique. We are presented with Tsukasa, Haruka, Sae, Ai, Rihoko and Kaoru as the six main girls and Risa as the seventh. Each of the girls has their own unique traits, hobbies and personalities, of which all of them are very entertaining and likable (depending on what type of person you are). Tsukasa appears to be a kind class representative, Haruka the popular senior, Ai and Sae as Miya’s friends, and the two childhood friends Rihoko and Kaoru. Junichi, the main male is kind, thoughtful and slightly perverted, but this side of him always ends up to be used in a form of comedy which ended up being very repetitive- overused until it just wasn't funny. The supporting characters do not have much effect on the story line; in fact, they don't really do much at all. There is little-to-no development of them at all, but it does not get agitating, unless one of them was your favourite character. In the Kaoru arc, there was a narrator speaking what was going on in Junichi’s mind sometimes. This was only slightly bothersome though, but it’s assured some people just won’t like it. 
 
The Enjoyment: 10/10 
-------------------------- 
If you are new to romance or drama Amagami SS might be a good choice to be introduced to the genre, if not it might all seem a little cliché. But I don’t care; I’m a sucker for cliché. Amagami SS first started in the form of a game, which was the adapted into an anime. I’ve seen some manga of Amagami, and it goes into a little more detail than the anime- not that the anime hasn’t touched on the subject at all but that it shows what is occurring at an event much better. Re-watching this anime definitely added to my personal enjoyment of the series. The satisfaction in seeing your favourite pair come together in the arc is what makes me come back to it. The anime was very memorable, even a few days after I had finished but I have to admit that it’s very less in my mind now as with all the other awesome anime I have watched. 
 
Overall: 9/10

Thanks for reading my review, or even parts of it- I don't blame you for reading all of it, but again, thanks you.

    If you don't know where you're from, then you don't know where you are, and you don't know where you're going. It's a fairly trite adage, but like most old sayings there's an element of truth to it. When it comes to visual media though, such sentiments seem to go out of the window, across the fields, and off into the wild blue yonder, especially where adaptations are concerned. 
 
So where does that leave Amagami SS? 
 
A number of people may already be familiar with the fact that the series is yet another adaptation of a dating sim, and given that this is the spiritual successor to Kimikiss, it's only natural that Enterbrain would attempt to emulate the relative success of the latter game and its anime adaptation. Unlike its predecessor though, Amagami SS decides to take a different approach with the storyline, and breaks things up into bite-sized relationship pieces that supposedly makes them easier to swallow, which works ... kind of. 
 
The series is split up into six short stories (and one ""special"" episode), that recount Tachibana Junichi's quest for high school love, and how he finds it with six different girls (and before you ask, no, this isn't School Days all over again). Along the way various relationship shenanigans ensue which cause the usual misunderstandings, reconciliations, attractions, repulsions, etc, etc. 
 
Now on the surface Amagami SS looks like the common or garden harem romantic comedy (but with the harem aspect applied in a different way). The plot follows the game's methodology by offering up multiple heroines for the protagonist to pursue, and while some may find this a refreshing approach, it's not really original as the series attempts to mask its shortcomings by adopting different narrative styles from one tale to the next. 
 
The biggest problem with short stories is that there needs to be enough content and context within the plot to justify the actions, thoughts and emotions of the characters, and it's surprising that Amagami manages to offer some semblance of a storyline over the course of each tale. Then again, the majority of development points where both the plot and the characters are concerned have really been done to death in anime and manga, so it's no surprise that there's at least a half decent story in there. 
 
After all, if you give enough monkeys enough time they can apparently produce Shakespeare (although it does make one wonder where they keep him). 
 
Each individual tale is pretty decent in its own right, but when one considers them as part of the whole a different picture begins to appear. What emerges are a series of contradictory actions and behaviours that don't really seem to make sense. Now these could be explained away by assuming that people act one way with one person, and another way with someone else, and so on, and one could easily view Amagami in this light. The problem is that this assumption ignores the portrayals of the characters in the previous stories, effectively making them little more than blank canvasses. To further compound this, certain characters seem to be clueless about the circumstances around people they've known for years. 
 
Still, if one simply treats them as a series of short stories then they can be entertaining, but the plot for each is nothing special, and the formulaic approach to each tale is, at times, a bit too familiar, and offers very little in the way of innovation, and rather a lot in the way of predictability. 
 
It's pretty obvious from the artwork that there is a large degree of genericism inherent in this anime, and Amagami does nothing to break away from the stereotypes. The high school setting, town and surrounding environs are nicely designed and detailed, but when it comes to rom-com anime, once you've seen one high school, you've pretty much seen them all. Granted there are a few exceptions to the rule,  but in general there's not much difference between the various depictions on offer. 
 
The design principle is a little bit strange in one respect (which I'll come back to in a bit), as the characters are nicely envisioned, but are also as generic as they come (much like a lot of things in this anime). That doesn't mean they're poorly realised though, as they're clearly based on Enterbrain's designs from the games, and coupled with some decent animation and backgrounds, they do give the show a familiarity that can sometimes be mistaken for quality. The acid test occurs when one compares the series to its spiritual predecessor, and although Kimikiss was produced by a different animation studio, there are a number of similarities that stand out, not the least of which is the look of the heroines. 
 
But simply looking like another show doesn't mean that the design and animation is substandard, and in all honesty Amagami does manage to hold it's own in the visuals department. It simply could have been better than it is, and it's puzzling why this isn't the case, especially for such a popular gaming franchise. 
 
One of the better aspects of the series is the music, specifically the manner in which it's used rather than the actual tracks played throughout the anime (which are fairly routine affairs, but that's pretty much expected by this point). There are far too many shows out there that play music for no specific reason, so it's nice to watch a series that treats silence as golden for a change, and this is something that works in Amagami's favour as it allows the viewer to focus on the characters without having to suffer through tunes that sound a lot like the music played in just about every other high school rom-com/drama ever made. 
 
That said, the music in itself isn't bad per se. It's simply ... generic (there's that word again), and even with two opening themes and six ending themes (sung by the lead actress from each character arc), there's little on offer that really stands out. Granted there are some decent enough songs (the law of averages and all that), but in all honesty this is probably nothing more than ""when you're given lemons, make lemonade"", or in this case, when you're given a romantic comedy drama, make a cheesy love song. 
 
Which leaves only the acting, and in this respect Amagami is a bit of a mixed bag. Maeno Tomoaki plays the role of Junichi rather well (even though it's a bit like playing the role of a wet paper bag at times), and the strength of his portrayal gives much needed support to the lead actress roles. 
 
See, here's the problem. No matter how good the seiyuu are, there's a limited amount that can be achieved in four episodes. Granted the actors and actresses have cameos throughout the series, but it's nowhere near enough time for them to truly come to grips with their characters. In this respect Kimikiss is actually superior, as by the end of that anime the seiyuu had grown accustomed to their roles and were able to play their parts with a confidence that, with the obvious exception of Maeno (who plays the only continuous lead character), none of the seiyuu in Amagami can match. 
 
All of which leads to the characters themselves, and in a nutshell they're as generic (I seem to be using that word a lot these days), as they come, but once again that doesn't automatically mean that they're bad. Junichi could very well be a poster boy for harem lead males, and fits just about every stereotype going, especially the ones about nice guys and being a little slow on the uptake. That said, he's a pleasant enough character, and as the only lead in focus throughout the series there is some development to be had, but the nature of the story dictates that this tends to be repetitive. 
 
Unfortunately the female leads aren't as clearly defined, and the reason for this is the relatively small amount of screen time they get. While they also grow as characters, this is tempered with a necessary urgency that precludes any substantial development. The supporting characters also suffer from the ""resetting"" of their personalities as this leads to repetitive behaviours and actions that simply don't go anywhere, and add nothing more than inane by-plays to the main narrative. 
 
Amagami SS isn't a bad show though, and it does have its plus points. The relationship mechanics are handled in a reasonable manner, and the characters, especially the male lead, aren't as wishy-washy as some I could name. The problem is that instead of trying something original, director Hiraike Yoshimasa and AIC have opted to follow a ""tried and tested"" method that will yield results when it comes to DVD sales and merchandising, but only in the short term, and this makes one wonder why a hugely popular game franchise like Amagami has an adaptation that is only passing good. 
 
The series is enjoyable to a degree, but it's still nothing more than one amongst many romantic comedies in anime, especially where schools are concerned. 
 
Given the popularity and fervour surrounding the games one would expect AIC to expend more effort on making the anime adaptation better than it is, especially where things like plot and design are concerned. Granted there's only so much one can do in that respect, but the overuse of stereotypes means that the whole series plays out like  nothing more than a glorified advert for the game(s). Like so many other game adaptations, the producers, director, animation studio, and just about everybody else in the making of this series have failed to realise the what fans really want. Instead of offering something that is an evolution of the franchise, we're treated to nothing more than a vapid retelling of the same old story. Even though the Amagami tries to be a little different with it's approach, one cannot laud the attempts to hide this anime's failings, especially the overtly generic design and plot, characters that don't really get the kind of attention needed to raise the level of the series, and an almost blind obedience to formula. 
 
In a very odd way, Amagami SS is a clear case of too many girls, not enough time, and the decision to make it in the first place seems to have had little to do with wanting to tell a story, and more to do with letting everyone know how good the games are. 
 
I suppose I can chalk this up as another ""victory"" for the marketing department.

    A Christian's Anime Review 
RahXephon 
 
Discernment Topics 
 
Violence: \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
Mechs and pseudo-organic creatures engage in melee combat and blast each other with energy. Blue blood often sprays as a result of wounds. 
Some people are shot, stabbed, and crushed off-screen in disasters. Blood is minimal. 
Military vehicles engage in combat with pseudo-organic creatures... and subsequently get exploded. (Because when has the military ever been able to fight mysterious monsters without the help of a protagonist?) 
 
Language:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
Frequent mild language. 
 
Spiritual Content:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
References to Mayan religion are made several times and constitute for some plot devices. One character is called a ""god"". 
The whole ""magic is just science"" approach could definently work to explain these things. 
 
Fanservice:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
Semi-perpetual mild fanservice. 
Occasional overt scenes that could be skipped. 
 
Misc. Suggestive Content:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
Some people may not like age gap relationships.

Story:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

Any issues with slow development speed are quickly overshadowed by great storytelling. 
 
Characters:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
10/10 
Likable and well developed. 
 
Art:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
8/10 
Dated, but fits well for the story it's telling. 
Action scenes certainly aren't held back. 
 
Sound:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
9/10 
OP is very good. ED is too. 
OST is jazzy and fits well. 
Some people might be annoyed by the humming sound the ""Dolems"" make as you'll hear it alot. 
 
Enjoyment:\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ 
10/10 
Very fun to watch and rewatch. 
My all time favorite series. 
 
Conclusion 
Fans of shonen, mecha, and psychological shows will enjoys this. 
Comparison is often made to ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"". The difference is ""RahXephon"" has a really good ending.

    This is.... 
 
This is on evangelion level. To be precise, it is on the level evangelion could've been, if things went differently, and circumstances aroudn first evangelion were more favorable... if Shinji wasn't a wuss, if the story was more complex. So perhaps you could say it surpasses even Evangelion. 
 
This anime, Rahxephon, is without a doubt on masterpiece level.  From the beginning that starts with an amazingly well done mindscrew, it presents a complex story resembling a puzzle, that is being shown out of order to you. Fior the duration of 26 episodes, it keeps throwing more and more pieces of the puzzle at you, and each piece you get is well crafted and well done. But even in the end at the final episode you'll still have to think and piece everything together by yourself. So do not expect questions to be easily answered here. 
 
One of the amazing aspects of this anime is musical component, and various creepy creatures that sing. The singing goes through the whole anime, creating some sort of unerathly, ethereial and magical overtones that go through the whole seriea.  
 
The story itself gives impression of something that is bigger than inidividual characters, than humanity as a whole, and in that sense it reseminds me of that time where I watched some of the best episodes of Legends of Galactic heroes, except that rahxephon is less indifferent towards its character, and rather than just giving you the big perpsective, it shows characters, entertwines their fates, plays with them, and then puts everything into events that are bigger than humans. 
 
And it works out amazingly well. 
 
Detailed breakdown below: 
 
Story: 10/10. This is outstanding. The anime has next to no filler, and manages to present its story in such way that you'll be figuring it out till the last second of the last episode. Even in this case there will be many things that are left to your interpretation, and are ambiguous. They make you think. 
 
The story also had some similarities to the more surreal parts of the anime such as The Big O. But explaining anything more without spoilers would've been difficult. 
 
There ARE some very minor issues such as characters occasionally displaying ""death flags"", which are highly predictable, but they're overshadowed by positive side of the experience. 
 
Art: 9/10: 
The art gets straight to the point. The characters have realistic proportions, do not ever go into chibi mode, there are details, but there are no details that are unnecessary. A similar art style, I believe was employed in ""Twelve Kingdoms"" (Juuni Kouki), and similar styles were employed in titles such as Tenchi Miyou.. or even Outlaw Star. Meaning ... fluid noticeable lines, but there are biger flat areas filled with the same color without overly focusing on shading.  
 
Sound: 9/10: Amazing soundscape through and through. The sound has a bit of ""non-standard harmony"" feeling about it, which creates eerie feeling that persists across the series. The musical theme of Rahxephon likewise dos great job depicting mysterious atmosphere about it.  
 
Character: 7/10: Characters are convincing enough, but I would say they're a bit on a predictable  side and sometimes are a bit naively portrayed. Some of the characters are a bit stereotypical as well. However, they're believable enough, and sympathetic in situations where they're portrayed. So they do their job. However the anime shines the most in situations where it goes into ""mindscrew"" mode, and starts throwing odd and strange imagery at the viewer. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10: Enjoyed it a lot, but there were some episodes in the middle which felt weaker for me. Still, watching it all the way till the end paid off with the ending. 
 
Overall: 10/10. This is a masterpiece level material, and ""highly recommended"" type of anime. IF you haven't seen it, you probably should give it a try. I can't really think of much reasons to skip this one. The story is interesting, eerie, makes you think, and it is a very interesting/unusual take on mecha genre as well. 
 
So if you have the time and an opportunity, check this one out.

    People are used to being fed information and not using their problem solving skills in most anime. Rahxephon does the opposite of that. You will have to use your problem skills, connect all the dots and watch it without distractions or you will find yourself lost and displeased with the ending. 
 
If you are able to understand the symbolism, the camera angles, use of lighting and the emotions that these characters are really feeling, you will come to find yourself to really enjoy this. Score:10/10 in my books. 
 
I found the story telling to be very consistent if you were paying attention by the way.

    Reality is a concept that has been used in various medium to explore many interesting concepts, not to mention how we as humans view reality. What isn't mentioned as frequently is how people try to run away from reality. This varies from seeing images of people that aren't real (focusing too much on positive or negative aspects of a person instead of seeing the whole picture), seeing the world either extremely positively or extremely negatively, or simply running away from interacting with people for fear they might hurt you. 
 
This is a fascinating concept that has been explored in many other anime series, from Neon Genesis Evangelion to Lain. What is different about RahXephon, however, is the way that it views that running away from reality may not necessarily be a bad thing, if it can help the people around you and accomplish something better for many people. 
 
This is treated with a great deal of ambiguity and is left morally grey for the viewer, and it wouldn't work if it wasn't for this show being excellent in presenting its story. The story is very distinct from many mecha series, and while there are undeniably massive influences from more popular mecha shows, the show soon develops an identity on its own and doesn't attempt to clone elements that simply were fit for those particular shows. 
 
The show is extremely rich in themes, from Mayan mythology to music to perception of reality and there is a lot of depth to sink your teeth into. The show is extremely skilled at making the viewer curious about the overall pieces of the plot, showing all of the clues and not holding the viewer's hand or lecturing them about plot details but instead using the absolutely stunning animation quality and various imagery to tell the story, and it works extremely well. 
 
The characters are all developed and almost none of them fall into archetypes that plague the genre. They are all distinct and multi-layered, which is very refreshing. Their actions always make sense, and they never act inconsistently or out of character, although many character actions require a rewatch to fully understand. 
 
The artwork looks gorgeous and the character designs are an absolute beauty to look at. The backgrounds and the scenery present throughout the show is beautiful to look at, which adds wonders to the show's tone and makes the show's presentation all the better. 
 
I cannot praise the absolutely amazing soundtrack enough, which fits the mood of the show, has extremely high hearing value outside of the show, and the various tunes present in the show which fit the mood so well and never feel out of place. This show has one of my favorite soundtracks out of anime and I honestly adore it to pieces. 
 
This show is underrated and under-appreciated, and while the show appears to be very unoriginal initially it quickly becomes very distinct and stands completely on its own. This show deserves more attention and I honestly recommend it a lot if you want a very different experience from your typical mecha anime.

    In the early 00's, a still-young anime studio whose most notable projects up to that point were tie-in movies to successful anime from their parent company hired a mechanical designer to serve as director for an anime-original project, hoping to create a series that would set a new standard for giant robot anime when many would argue that had already been done. This is how RahXephon came to be, and the end result is as difficult to describe and discuss now as it was to predict then. Knowing where to begin, though, has always been painfully easy. RahXephon is not trying to be Neon Genesis Evangelion. Whether you found Eva to be a spectacular failure or just plain spectacular, its goals are not Rah's goals, and to call RahXephon either a ripoff or an improvement of Evangelion would be unfair to both anime. RahXephon has its own story to tell and its own messages to convey, and while it may not have taken the world by storm the way Eva did, the strength of its core, beauty of its craftsmanship, and humanity of its characters still set it apart as an excellent work that can stand tall on its own. 
 
Still, their similarities needn't be ignored completely for a discussion to be worthwhile; they do exist and people will inevitably notice them. RahXephon is an introspective giant robot anime about a uniquely qualified pubescent pilot who gets drafted by a shady organization to fight otherworldly monsters to protect a world that's already been shaken by a cataclysmic event that took place during an iconic year, while also struggling to deal with puberty, distant parents, his own sense of self-worth, romantic entanglements, the expectations of adults, and growing up in general. There's no question it would've been made very differently—or not made at all—in a world where Evangelion didn't exist, and RahXephon even pays its more famous forerunner direct, loving homage a few times. My personal favorite is a scene in episode 11 that is a backwards shot-for-shot remake of an iconic (and awkward) scene from Eva episode 5. Except that the context, meaning, and emotions conveyed are all completely different, which says a lot about RahXephon as a piece of art inspired by another piece of art. Evangelion was a very important influence to RahXephon, but their similarities are only skin-deep. True inspiration means borrowing concepts that you admire or find fascinating, and then casting them in a completely new light to create something new that reflects your unique view of the world rather than repeating someone else's, which director Yutaka Izubichi and his crew have done admirably. 
 
Evangelion is also far from the only influence that colors this series. RahXephon draws from many older, perhaps forgotten mecha anime as well, notably Brave Raideen, which informed the design of the titular titan and some of the series' mythology. Outside of anime, the series blends influences from numerous cultures, time periods and media both obvious and obscure, from ancient Mesoamerican civilizations to Japanese folklore to Churchward's mythical continent of Mu to the paintings of Salvador Dali. Thankfully, most of these cultural references have some narrative or thematic connection to the story and never truly cross into ""details for the sake of details"". The series can be watched and thoroughly enjoyed without having read The Dandelion Girl or understanding the meanings of musical terms like Allegretto and Falsetto, but that extra knowledge is a nice bonus if you're willing to hunt for it. The world of RahXephon is saturated with subtle and not-so-subtle details and eye-catching visual concepts almost to the point of overload, but all the seemingly disparate pieces fit together in the end, at least in spirit, and everything in its world feels like it belongs there. 
 
RahXephon was also blessed with the technical and artistic strengths to convey that world. This was one of Bones' first projects as an independent studio, and also made during the very early days of digital animation. But the results wildly exceed expectations and have stood the test of time very well. The character designs are sharp and distinctive, and their facial expressions are capable of communicating all manner of complex, subtle emotions with great finesse, which is especially important in a series where characters have a tendency to say a few words to convey volumes of meaning. These are further bolstered by excellent cinematography, beautifully rendered backgrounds and brilliant color choices, with particular emphasis on contrasts between red and blue. The animation itself can be limited compared to modern Bones and some of the effects are noticeably dated, but for the most part it knows its limitations and works well within them. The design work on display is more than enough to carry it even at its most restrained, and the staff at Bones knew how to manage their money, meaning the animation peaks at all the right moments. At worst the production work here is still a notch above merely competent (with one or two noticeable but ultimately forgivable dips in quality), and at best it's a visual treat over a decade later. 
 
While the animation has aged quite well, time has not been so kind to the English dub, but it's not for lack of effort. Contrasting the more low-key and soothing Japanese language track, the dub is loud and raw to a fault. On the downside, this means that some characters sound awkward and over-acted, and at times unsure of the emotions they're supposed to be conveying. Some actors take several episodes to grow into their roles, and others never do at all, to say nothing of some of the stiff, overly direct translations they have to read. Still, a few good performances can do a lot to elevate an uneven product, and the standouts of this dub own their roles completely. Chris Patton, who plays the protagonist Ayato, captures the thoughtful and strong-willed but at times emotionally immature teenager remarkably well, and Monica Rial does a positively bang up job capturing both the tough and fragile sides of Haruka. Both actors have cited their roles (and this series) as personal favorites, and the passion behind their performances can be felt. While this isn't enough to recommend the overall very clunky English dub over the far more polished Japanese version, it may still be worth a listen. 
 
But in a show that uses music prominently as a motif, it’s the soundtrack that really holds it all together. The composer, Ichiko Hashimoto, is a jazz pianist who’s never scored an anime series before nor since, and she gave RahXephon a sound unlike that of any other anime. An eclectic blend of rock, jazz, chamber music and several other styles integrate effortlessly and give the series a personality that's classy and dignified, yet also friendly and inviting. It's also an incredibly diverse score that can explode into blaring trumpets and war drums when a battle begins, descend into glorious experimental madness when Ayato enters a dream sequence, and envelop its audience in enigmatic, otherworldly chanting as we delve further into the mysteries of the Mu. The only songs not composed by Hashimoto are the opening theme, ""Hemisphere"", and ""Garden of Everything"", which is never used in the show but is nonetheless perhaps RahXephon's most iconic song and perfectly encapsulates what the story is really about. Both pieces are composed by Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto (the latter is a duet with Steve Conte), and both are completely worthy additions to an already outstanding soundtrack, making it a must-listen for anime music enthusiasts. 
 
If RahXephon were a conventional mech action series, it could be recommended on the strengths of its style and aesthetic alone, but delivering spectacular robot fights isn't its first concern. Like an Evangelion unit, the RahXephon moves quite organically, but unlike an Eva its movements always seem burdened by its own weight. Every motion it makes is slow and deliberate, and consequently from an action choreography standpoint it simply doesn't have the cool factor Evangelion did. That's not to say the fights lack tension or suspense or a sense of purpose, though. The monsters, enormous clay puppets called Dolems, are varied in both their designs and abilities, often genuinely threatening, and the battles against them are filled with unique imagery. It can be quite captivating to see an organic golem split in half while gushing blue blood. During one battle, there is a shot of the RahXephon's hand forcing its way out through a Dolem's face, fingers emerging around its still-screaming mouth, and it’s just as awesome as it sounds. But generally this series doesn't have the pulse-pounding blow-by-blow excitement of a true action series. While Eva is mostly remembered and revered as a heavily introspective character piece, part of the reason for its mass appeal was that it could initially hook audiences on pure, powerful spectacle. RahXephon has no such hook early on, and this can present a challenge to new viewers who don't know what kind of anime to expect. 
 
And indeed, the question of what to expect going into RahXephon is not an easy one to answer. We see the world mostly through Ayato's eyes and learn as he learns, from the ground up. It takes a full three episodes to reveal the very basic premise you'd generally expect to see on the cover of the box, and another two or three to establish a solid dynamic that the rest of its episodes can build off of. From there it becomes somewhat easier to follow, but this is definitely not a series you can multitask while watching. RahXephon's mysteries are many, complex, and very slow to unravel, and if you're not paying careful attention you'll end up missing a lot. This is a mature, adult fantasy that speaks eloquent words in a soft voice, delivering key plot points and casual character interactions with equal importance. Like watching a painter at his craft, whether you can see beauty in each individual stroke or are just waiting for the finished product will come down to your own patience and proclivities. 
 
The ""strokes"" with which RahXephon paints its picture are its characters, and at the center of its cast is the hero Ayato Kamina. Ayato is a seemingly ordinary teenager who lives in a version of Tokyo that has been displaced from the rest of time and space, and leaves his home to discover that he is destined to ""tune the world"". Over the course of the series, he slowly discovers the truth about the separation between the blue-blooded Mulians that now occupy the world known as Tokyo Jupiter and the red-blooded human beings they've isolated themselves from, unlocks the secrets of the powerful golem known as the RahXephon, and must find out what his own role is in this war between worlds with powerful figures and close friends and family pulling at him from both sides. But while the power he's been granted may be extraordinary, Ayato himself always feels like a fully realized, thoroughly grounded, and very real person, despite his reality being repeatedly turned on its head. He's not above the influence of others, often getting dragged along one way or another when he's lost and without direction, sometimes escaping one controlling environment only to fall into another one. He also has a dangerous habit of not asking important questions when he's afraid of what he'll find. But he still acts on his own agency, lashing out when he feels wronged, deceived or betrayed and drawing his own conclusions, for better or for worse, from every new discovery he makes. 
 
Still, Ayato is just one in a cast of around twenty characters, and to the series' credit, they all very much take on a life of their own, many of them growing far outside of the archetypes it'd be easy to initially pin them as. Supporting Ayato, in every sense of the word, is Haruka, the woman who pulled him out of his world, known as Tokyo Jupiter, and into hers. It becomes immediately clear that while her intentions toward Ayato are benevolent, she's not being completely honest about her motivations, and her tough, confident exterior belies a very old, very deep emotional wound that she cannot bury no matter how hard she tries. She and Ayato—and the relationship between them—are the clear heart and soul of the story, but they are far from the only great characters worth mentioning. The other cast members have varying levels of depth and complexity, but the series still manages to breathe life and humanity into nearly all of them, ranging from the wonderfully complex characters like Ayato's estranged mother Maya and the outwardly cheerful but distant and secretive Doctor Itsuki, to simple, likable ordinary people like the idealistic but dependable TERRA officer Souichi and the reporter Futagami, a character whose sole purpose in the story seems to be spouting exposition, and yet every moment he spends onscreen is a delight. Together, they lend the series a warm, earthy charm that helps to keep it emotionally accessible even when it gets intellectually overwhelming. 
 
Like any great painting, though, the true beauty of RahXephon lies not in its individual strokes, but in how they come together. This is a story of resonance between worlds and between people, and its true depths only surface when two characters are given the chance to talk and interact, and the bonds between them are forged, tested, broken and reformed. ""Words can't change anything,"" Ayato says. ""They can when people talk to each other,"" his friend Souichi replies. And talk they do. Whether it's casual banter between friends, key exposition to give the audience and characters another piece of the puzzle, or a thoughtful elaboration on the series' themes, nearly every exchange flows with stunning natural ease, and quite a few of them are surprisingly high-minded and poetic, shedding light on some fantastically nuanced relationships. There's Maya, for instance, and her relationship with Ayato, which is caught between her genuine desire to care for him as a son and her obligation to raise the perfect Instrumentalist. The compromise she reaches between the two is understandable and even sympathetic, but bears disastrous results. Rebound, unrequited and possessive love are given their due alongside the real thing because, after all, they're a part of life too, and seeing characters connect or fail to connect is a rich enough experience that it could have been its own reward. 
 
But then there's the conflict between the Mu and the red-blooded humans, which gradually becomes world-ending in scope and scale as the deadline for ""tuning the world"" approaches. Attempting to balance and reconcile these two storytelling approaches could have resulted in the series becoming dichotomous and unbalanced. But RahXephon utilizes its larger conflicts to give weight, context and justification to the wide range of small personal issues its cast finds themselves contemplating and debating, often using parallel editing to highlight this, most notably during the iconic, incredibly cinematic climax of episode 19. This comes full circle in the finale, where Ayato finds himself empowered to tune the world and create something new, but he would not be able to accomplish this without a vision, and he derives his vision for a new world from the things he has seen and people he has met in the current one. Inspiration. This series may not be as trailblazing as Evangelion, but it is a passionate, elegantly crafted and thoughtfully woven story about all the timeless, unchanging things that make us human. 
 
Ultimately, RahXephon is about something old as dirt, infinitely complex and incredibly simple. RahXephon is about love, in all its shades and hues. Connecting with others can bring pain and hardships, but a world without these bonds is sterile and joyless. The freedom to choose the life you want to live and the person you want to be with, even if that choice leads to suffering, is something everyone needs to live a fulfilling life, and if you find someone you want to be there for, even as the world is coming down around you, then your existence is a meaningful one. It’s an overwhelmingly positive and empowering message that feels completely earned, and that’s something to be celebrated. Simply put, RahXephon is fantastic. It successfully unites a grand, ambitious story, lofty artistry, and a beating human heart, and the end result resonates long after the final curtain has fallen. That’s more than enough to cement it as an enduring great that deserves to be remembered and rediscovered for many years to come.

    Arc-based harem show Amagami could be brilliant if not the presence of following minor drawbacks: 
1. Its too long, to be honest there are only 3 interesting heroines in Amagami, watching other arcs easily become boring and frustrating (especially with useless Sakurai) 
2. While Amagami is not entirely fanservice-based, there are many service thingies that could be easily skipped in favor of relationship development. 
In my point of view if you skip heroines you don't like you will get great show definitely worth your time.

    I recommend you watch this anime if you have nothing else to watch.Its really mediocre but i give it  6 Overall because i like mecha anime.This anime is interesting but only a little bit.The plot is really hard to understand and quite boring at first.Later they start making better plot but still not a story that will make you excited.The thing i didn't like the most are the looks of mecha.Skulls,head etc.It gives a story more dark feeling but they failed there too.It only makes it depressing.I have not finished this anime yet but i will and then i will update my review but only if things get interesting if not this is what you get.The main character isn't taking his situation very well at first and we can see few hints of romance now and then.In the plot there is someone who is like our MC but for now their view on the life is very different.This is it from me this time i didn't want to write anymore because it would have spoilers and with slow story development you need something new.I usually dont write bad critics like this but i need to be honest and of course everyone have their own taste so anyways i hope you will enjoy it

    Post-cataclysmic-train-crash, our protagonist Ayato, looking for medical assistance for his moderately injured friends, finds his way through the rubble and out of the underpass. A siren blares and a jet explodes overhead.  
 
A passing tank driver: ""You there, civilian! Move out of the way! 
 
Seconds later, with Ayato situated a few yards away, the anti-aircraft guns of the tank opens fire. A few more seconds later, the tank fucking explodes. Ayato is forcefully knocked back by the blast. Completely lucid, clearly lacking ruptured eardrums, he takes in some air and lets out a good Shinji scream as the camera pans up to the sky.  
 
Scene end. 
 
Ayato runs a bit, seeking help for his friends. Out of breath he takes a seat. 
 
Ayato: ""What the hell. Give me a break already. How will I find help for Friend A and Friend B?"" 
 
But, Ayato is cut short. The building above him fucking explodes and a mass of concrete comes crashing down, nearly flattening our young protagonist. 
 
Shrugging off the rubble, unharmed Ayato peers through the lingering dust and smoke to find his notably female classmate, Mishima. They grab some orange juice from a vending machine and forget about Friend A and Friend B. 
 
Mishima: ""Is this a war?"" 
 
Ayato: ""Yeah its a war.    
 
He takes a sip and squats down. 
 
Ayato: ""But man, what a surprise! I never expected to see you here!"" 
 
Scene End. 
 
Mishima and Ayato run around the streets of Tokyo as the battle ensues around them. Ayato looks up and notes the giant fucking woman floating around in the sky. 
 
Ayato: ""Is that a secret weapon of the Japanese Defense Force?"" 
 
Scene End. 
 
Ayato goes on to resist arrest (at gunpoint) from armed members of the police, make jokes involving older women and butts, and go willingly into an Egyptian crypt found in the middle of Tokyo (at the end of the public subway line).

    Okay so this is my first review... I first started watching this show after listening to DJ Sharpnel's ""World Sound"" and wondered if there was a theme song for some anime that was in it so I scrolled down... and found about 5 different people saying ""It's the opening theme for RahXephon"" 
 
SO I decided to look at it and from episode 1 I was confused as hell... but when I got to the 4'th episode... I COULD NOT STOP WATCHING IT. The story just wraps itself around you and sucks you in. I LOVED how the main character, Ayato Kamina had to literally accept reality as it was and that the world he was in wasn't really a thing. I loved the fight scenes, the humour was done just right as well. The best part however, aside from Ayato accepting reality, was the romance. it was extremely well done and sometimes blatant, but sometimes subtle and you'd have to pay attention and see who wants who. 
 
Overall I would strongly recommend this to anyone who loves a good story driven anime, it will completely suck you in for the 26 episodes. It might seem short but it's amazing. Check it out!

    RahXephon caught my attention for probably the wrong reason, and maybe it’s also the reason that you want to watch it, but I’ll say this about RahXephon. Any comparison to Evangelion is stupid, because RahXephon is two things: A show that is just as good, if not better (depending on who you ask) than Evangelion and a show in its own right. Just because its shares some similarities with Evangelion doesn’t mean it shouldn’t exist or that it’s a bad show and if you don’t take my word for it…. Watch the show and make your own judgement, and for those who don’t have a clue what Evangelion is, don’t you worry your pretty little heads about it. 
 
The Short Version: 
(+)The music man, THE MUSIC! 
(+)The emotional impact of some scenes are phenomenally executed. 
(+)The pace of the story is damn near perfect. 
(+)There’s not a lot to hate. 
(-)The art is a little bit dated. 
 
Story (9/10): When you look at the synopsis, the first thought you’ll have about the story is that it’s probably about saving the world, as it is with most Mecha shows, or just most shows in general, and you’d kinda be wrong. While the story is about saving the world, it’s a lot more focused than just that general goal, focusing more on the hero and the people helping him save the world instead of the actual saving itself. That’s the thing I feel will draw you to this show, because it just builds the characters to such a point that when they go into battle that doesn’t look that great, you’re actually scared for these characters. 
 
I’m not even going to get into all of the Mayan and Aztec culture references, and just how psychologically deep they get with the main characters, other people will do and have done that for me, and I’ve always geared myself towards strictly entertainment value, like 90% of the community BUT. If you like your anime to be a bit more intellectual then RahXephon’s got you covered. Hell, that’s the reason people call it a rip-off of Evangelion. 
 
Characters (10/10): When I look at the characters in this anime (As in all of those with a name.) I look at them and I feel like all of them are actual people and I could tell you that this person loves that person, this person is secretly related to that person but not by blood, but before that a quick run-down of the main characters: 
 
Ayato Kamina: The pilot of RahXephon and the one who faces many a dilemma to come. 
 
Shitow Haruka: Mother figure to Ayato and seems to know something about Reika 
 
Quon Kisaragi: The ‘mysterious’ character and the one who doesn’t mind just casually touching Ayato whenever she wants. 
 
Reika Mishima: Classmate of Ayato and is somehow connected to RahXephon. 
 
While the entire cast does get some development in, there’s always the few who don’t but in this case I’m going to wave that aside because: 
1. Its only 4 characters and 
2. They development everyone else more than they needed to. 
 
The script writer really went all out when thinking of the character development, and sometimes it’s not even your normal; Character-tells-other-character-something-just-within-earshot-of-the-MC, it’s more, yeah-there's-something-in-this-shot-that-tells-you-about-this-character. An example is how they development the commander, who comes off as a dick up until a certain point, but then the episode finishes and you suddenly know why he is such a straight collar military man to his core, this sort of development happens to almost every character with the exception of only a few. 
 
Art & Sound (8/10 & 10/10): The art for the time would’ve been just fine, even nowadays it would hold its own with most of the common show’s that come out. Not the prettiest show to look at, but its fluid as hell, for back then this was probably considered some of the best stuff you could do without treading into movie territory. The sound HAD to be good, considering that the show involves crypt dialogue that heavily hints at musical piece, hell the core elements of the show, RahXephon and Ayato, are later referred to in musical terms. So with all that in account I can say that…. The sound is bloody beautiful, if I find an OST disc I’m buying without a doubt. Keep in mind I only have one other OST disc. I take my OST’s very seriously. 
 
What do you think of this anime? 
 
I ordered a copy off eBay as soon as I finished it. 
 
Would you recommend this anime? 
 
Yes. Hell yes. In my opinion this anime is grossly underrated because of its apparent ripping off, but if the Evangelion was never made, this show may very well be on the same level of fame as Evangelion. Yeah I think it’s that good, you should go watch it for your own opinion. 
 
 
Goodbye my brethren, See you in the next.

    This show had a tedious beginning where I began to start asking about 100 questions right out of the gate. Although it does seem to smooth out in the middle, it fails in helping me appreciate it more when it kept intoducing more and more questions for me to answer. The last part of the series was probably the best part as characters started to become more likeable and believable in their actions. The love story is decent between Ayato and Haruka, but it doesn't seem to scream out perfect couple since it felt bizare to see the two communicate or work together to resolve their conflicts. Overall, it is a good anime, however I would not reccommend it to those who want an opening to pull them directly into the series.

    Before I get started I would like to get one thing out of the way, a  disclaimer for pretty much anyone that is either a fan of or has simply seen the anime ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"". 
to put it simply these anime's have very blatant similarities for which I will not get into the details of but just as a bit of warning to any one that really liked NGE and sees this anime and gets a little upset that they did kinda take a few attributes from NGE as this came out about 7 years after NGE and it seems like a blatant copy cat, that is not particularly true as the story goes in a different direction than NGE, but I am only writing this to let you know, because I may mention Evangelion from time to time but I will try not to mention it to much. 
O.K? lets begin 
 
Impression: 
The set up of this show is pretty good however maybe a little confusing at first as it is not intirely clear who is the actual enemy and what is actually going on until around episode 4 when the series really gets rolling and you finally get everything, though they do take you on a bit of a ride while doing it. 
The show like evangelion does go over psycho analysis but in this series the psycho analysis is not as crucial or is not given as much attention but is still entertaining to watch. The over all setting is an interesting one as things are a little normal but not really as humanity still has to fight off the ""Mu"" who are an advanced civilization from another dimension and have occupied tokyo aka ""Tokyo Jupiter"" for it's out ward appearance. This anime does a pretty good job at keeping things interesting and the whole thing seemed pretty well planned out with character development and the it didn't get repetitive and episodic with a monster of the week sort of deal and there were defiantly parts that I thought were all around genius in execution. 
the only cons in my initial impression was that this wasn't the greatest anime, I didn't feel like a great anime but as I like back on it now, I thought it was pretty damn good, but not perfect. 
 
Characters: 
I will admit that the characters of RahXephon were a little hard to warm up to at first but as you get to know them and you get see them more you come around to really like them. 
The first character is Ayato Kamina aka Shinji ikari with a back bone. one thing I liked about this character is that despite his fears of piloting a giant robot to protect humanity he does understand the importance of such a task which was kind of a refreshment in comparison to some of Evangelion's characters. 
Next is Huruka Shitow aka Misato with short hair, I didn't get particularly attached to this character in particular as she seemed like a copy and paste Misato from evangelion. 
The last one I'm going to mention is Quon Kisaragi, who was actually like none of eva's characters, she was happy, curious, and was a rather unique character as she would say things in some cryptic manner that made her interesting. 
 
Final verdict: 
I'm going to give this one an 8 out of 10 
and I would recommend this to anyone with an empty after noon or is looking for an alternative to evangelion.

    Whenever you look at a list for an upcoming season I pretty much ignore Visual Novel adaptations. I feel I have good reasons for doing so since very rarely do they tell a story nicely, flesh out the characters from the game or give a satisfying ending. For that reason, I told myself I wouldn't watch Amagami.  
 
Then one day I was visiting 4chan for a minute just out of sheer boredom and saw a fairly expansive thread about this show. After browsing it they made it seem like maybe I should give it a watch. I did just that and I was wowed by it. The show works in arcs, 4 episodes in length, each highlighting a different female protagonist.  There is a reset after each arc, but in those arcs you get closure and development. 
 
I don't think any show captures the thrill, the nerves, and the butterflies of meeting someone new and developing feelings for them. It's the most invigorating feeling in the world and something that comes along very rarely. This show thrives on that feeling in almost a reflective and melancholic way. The score is very subdued and just accentuates the gentle feelings the characters accumulate towards one another or the way the Autumn sky looks stretched out above them. They got so many little things right in this show. The characters even flirt like real people. I have watched Anime my entire life and I feel like this is the only show that has ever gotten flirting right. Maybe the Japanese don't do it like we do here in the Northeast US, but it's so refreshing to see Anime characters act like people.  
 
There are flaws to the show. There is an arc where they try to play it off as a romantic comedy with a terrible narrator and badly written jokes. There was an arc or two where the ending didn't work but those are minor to me. This show doesn't hold back, at the end of each arc the main character explores these girls he meets, he develops something with them, and they find what they were looking for. There is no cop out ending. Maybe doing the arcs with resets is seen as a cop out by some, but I see it as a way of giving the show a way to do what it has to do. And what it does is give us a romance Anime actually about romance. I wish more shows took a lead from this because this show is ahead of the curve in so many ways.

    Nice to meet you, neko here, another fan of moe which some people call it 'crap'. I'd like to share my opinion about this anime. Too bad I don't own a console, so I haven't played the game yet. But I'll show what this anime version of PS2 game (eh?) is made of. 
 
The background story is about a guy who suck in his love life. His attempt to date someone failed once when he was still in middle school. His girlfriend-to-be is not coming to their first date. After few years, he's already in his second year of high school, encountering many beauties, and finally date one in each ending of 4 episode. 
Yes, this anime is telling all of the character ending. So if you kinda don't like harem, this anime is for you guys. These story itself quite touching actually. 
 
The very-o-my-god-i-love-this-series point is the character concept. Every character have their own good points. Fun pesonality of Haruka, gentleness of Ai, the daring Kaoru, the fatty chubby yet loyal Rihoko, cute junior Sae, and two-faced yet lovable Tsukasa. The spotlight of this show is the great-great characters. Each character have their own trait, problem, story, and development. Very recommended for moe hunter. 
 
 
Vanilla. The very impression of this anime. 
Really sweet romance could make me rolling around with my blanket, cuteness overload. If you wanna know my reaction while watching this series is like : URRGGHHHHAAAAAAAAAA HUNYUUUUUUU FUAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAH HAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU OMOCHIKAERII!! 
That's it. Please support me if you find this helpful.

    I'll say right  off the bat I was caught off guard with this anime. If I had to compare my experience with Amagami SS with something the best example I can think of is your first time eating fast food. Going in you have your preconceptions for what your getting yourself into. You may not be a connoisseur but you've been around the block a time or two. So, when you out of the corner of your eye you see this little beauty your fancy is a little trickled. You go in, take a few names and set yourself up with the belief that this burger will be just like all the others. But then it occurs to you. What you just ate was no burger. You just had yourself a McRib. You don't remember ordering a McRib but nonetheless you enjoyed it. I""m going to let you stew on that as I begin the review. 
 
Story-10 
Junichi Tachibana is a junior in high school who has been through some trials in the past and sadly didn't escape unscathed. Two years prior to where the story sets off on Christmas Eve, Junichi was stood up by a girl and hasn't exactly come to terms with it.  
Make no mistake this is a Harem but it goes in a Ground Hog Day style of telling its story by showing us each girls Arc in a certain amount of episodes and when that girl's Arc as ended the story resets as we start again with a different girl. I will say that much like apples not every Arc is created equal story wise. For the majority of the Arcs they are given the same amount of episodes to tell their story. Well some use this time magnificently, others sadly aren't up to par but this is just my own observation. 
 
Art-8 
I'm no expert when it comes to art and the like so I will make this quick. 
The animation was great and was from what I observed mostly drawn with minimal CGI. The character designs were good but at times I confused some characters because they looked so similar to each other but this rarely was the case. 
 
Sound-7 
The soundtrack was well done and the music was appropriate for the scenes where they played. However the tracks did repeat here and their but not enough to where I could hum it to myself. The sound effects were good and helped with the taste of  immersion. 
 
Character-9 
The characters in Amagami SS come in all shapes and sizes. I enjoyed some and were less than happy with others. I'll focus mainly on the protagonist and his muses but I will say a bit about the supporting characters. 
I felt that the supporting characters were in word underdeveloped. I won't say where or when but their was a time where I had greater interest in the supporting characters then the girl in the Arc. If anything they reminded me a lot of the supporting characters in South Park. They help progress the plot but don't really do anything otherwise. 
On the man of the hour himself Junichi. To put it lightly Junichi is a man who (depending on the Arc) has seen and done somethings that some may deem unnatural. He is hard to describe as with each girl's Arc is different so is Junichi. Deep down hes the same guy but at times through the series I was uncertain how he would react to certain situations. Anymore would be going into spoiler territory and I don't want that. 
The heroines of Amagami SS were for lack of a better word unique. I loved the Arcs for many (Tsuksa, Morishima, Nanasuki) and disliked others (Sae, Rihoko, Kaoru). Still each girl is the star of her own Arc and they made the series a blast. 
 
Enjoyment-9 
In my eyes this show ranks how above many of the Harems I have seen in my day.  I found myself laughing out loud at times which with me being a fan of dark comedy says a lot. I can't leave until I say something about the ending. This series has one of those endings that had me feeling a cocktail of volatile emotions of which I rarely show(thank god I was alone in my apartment at the time). The ending in short will make you feel things.  
 
Overall-9 
The series was fantastic and good enough that I might have to revisit it someday.

    Very interesting anime...Instead  of using 13 or 26 episodes to tell the story of just a boy and a girl..They use different girls on one guy..I's like  the ""Another world Kyo chapter""  in Clannad..Different story with everyone..Although we don't see much of the same girl we get a lot of them..6 I think..So no one can  really  be upset about the Main character making a wrong decision or not  choosing the girl the viewer likes...Cause we see him ending up with all of them in the different scenarios

    As some people would know, amagami SS is based on a ps2 love simulation game that was made in 2009. It features Tachibana Junichi in his quest to recover from his broken heart. 
 
Story: 
This would be a standard guy interacts with multiple girl plot line but what the producers have done is split each heroine's arc separately from each other meaning that a few eps is dedicated to one heroine which makes it feel a love simulation game(generally thats how the flow of these games work). 
 
Character development: 
Since each heroine gets a few eps to themselves you can expect a good amount of interaction between each of the heroines. 
 
Art/Animation: 
The art is what you expect of a 2010 anime, the colors are quite vibrant. The animation is quite well done as well the interchange between scenes feels natural. 
 
Sound: 
The Opening themes gives a very nice vibe for this highschool romance. Having each heroine sing the ED gives a  a distinct feel for each of the heroine arcs. 
 
That's it for my review if you like to see my personal opinion of this anime please check out my page.

    This is my first review, i will avoid as many spoilers as possible 
Amagami SS is a fantastic anime that focuses on highschool romance. Our protagonist- Tachibana Junichi, dates 6 different girls, all in different arcs (lucky) 
The 6 are as follows in show order- Morishima Haruka, Tanamachi Kaoru, Nakata Sae, Nanasaki Ai, Sakurai Rihoko and finally Ayustuji Tsukasa. None of these girls make you feel like you want to hate them, in fact i loved them all (okay i do have a bias but everyone will) 
 
Story was excellant, the plot was great for being a 4 episode arc or each. Each arc focuses on one girl however there are always snippets of the other girls going on with their friends even while Tachibana is dating another one. A side note, there is always that protagonist best friend, and in our case, its the lovely sushi cook's son, umehara. They are buddies and they share 1 thing that reflects on many people :3 
 
Character- Character plot was well done, many of them knew tachibana beforehand, some of them never knew him. they are all lovely in the inside and each somehow fits as Tachibana's girlfriend. Although it makes me depressing that such people can't exist in my life :C 
 
Enjoyment- I loved this anime. The romance was just so cute, the lines were well written. Great comedy in the anime, beautiful heart-touching romance that will make people like me fanboy so hard they start squealing (yes okay i squealed when i saw the amagami ss+ plus last episode)  
 
Overall- i love this anime, it definately belongs in my top 5 for its smart writing, great plot line for each arc, and just filling me with cute ""fluffy"" romance  
 
Sorry i don't take note in art and sound as much as other people, I'm all for the story, development, character and enjoyment 
 
I zettaini recommend this anime :D

    I saw all 26 episodes on hulu. It was very enjoyable. I am glad that it was a anime focusing on different relationship arcs. I usually dislike it when there is more then 1 girl chasing after the male protagonist.

    Not a bad anime, as others have states.  Just not my cup of tea.  I like to binge watch shows, when I have a lot of spare time.  That being said with this anime I could not.  I had to watch each arch separated by some time.  If it took any of the stories and kept it going I would have loved that.  Sadly it felt like a bunch of 4 episode anime's packaged together with all the restarting.  Just a personal issue others do not seem to mind, but please note if you are like me and like to binge watch 12+ episodes as to not think about the plot to much and spoil it for yourself but get a lot out of it, then this is not for you.  Sure you can knock these out but I would have loved to get more out of it.  I did not realize it kept switching and restarting before I stared sadly and I am a completionist.  Though I will not ever watch this again.

    I picked up _Amagami_ out of curiosity for how the galge genre is doing these days. Overall, I'm not hugely impressed, except I really like Morishima - an interesting character who isn't in the usual 'school idol' mold but appealingly eccentric and bizarre. (Alas, Kaoru has a better visual design.) I do admire the adaptation for not coming up with a contrived way of doing all the girls' arcs in a single sustained continuity (sorta hobbles various Key adaptations, always thought). 
 
Going into more detail: a little disappointed in the Ayatsuji arc which neglected to explain all the Chekovian guns it left laying around like her 'scribbles' and the sister-hatred, but was still good. Rihoko arc was kind of a drag, but more slice-of-life and food-centric as I had expected. Ai arc felt kind of like a watered-down Morishima. Sae arc was daww-licious. Last episode was all kinds of troll-awesome - crazy stalker girl torpedoes every budding relationship aforementioned, and Junichi - that reincarnation of Jesus - *still* manages to love her. Hilarious. 
 
(Finally: I was driven nearly to insanity by the second OP, which opens as a veritable *gem* of J-pop - and then instantly degrades into mediocrity only to revive a while later with those opening lines and then throws them away. Is there a name for when something could have been insanely awesome but wasn't but you can still see the bits of insanely awesome glinting out and you have a vague idea of what you have lost? Maybe they put the *real* version in one of the OSTs...)

    Amagami SS was a pretty well done harem series with a few nice additions. The male protagonist was much better than many other male leads in other harems because he wasn't a douchebag like other male leads *cough* school days *cough* 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
Amagami SS is a pretty unique harem in the sense that the storyline is divided into arks that have relatively nothing to do with each other. Instead of one continual storyline, the story is broken up into several smaller stories.  
 
Art: 9/10 
 
The art was pretty well done with no noticeable inconsistencies and was eye appealing. 
 
Sound: 8.5/10 
 
The OPs and EDs were both relatively enjoyable to watch and listen to, but I don't remember any noticeable OSTs that were playing in the background. On a side note, the anime does a nice job using different voice actors to sing their own EDs for their own arks. 
 
Characters: 8.5/10 
 
The characters each had their own development, however, without the continual storyline, these character developments were lost after each ark which was kind of sad to see. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
 
It's a pretty good anime that I would recommend to everyone who likes the harem genre as it is a relatively different approach to the harem genre.

    I love you forever with you... for four episodes, that is. 
 
My attention was pointed to Amagami SS after watching this season's Seiren. I heard tales of ""Oh, this is much worse than the original anime Amagami SS. The concept is executed much better."" And thus I watched Amagami SS. 
 
The music for Amagami SS wasn't bad, besides the questionable grammar of the  second sentence of the first OP. It was nice that each girl got to sing their own ED. I particularly enjoy when animes do that, just like the Monogatari series. 
 
The setting and background of each story is exactly the same. It's a little strange Returning to Zero after each arc, but that's what happens when you get an anime from a visual novel. The novelty of this concept gets old around the 3rd or 4th time. If you've watched time travel or alternate reality stuff, it's not really anything new though. There are some cheeky little surprises for those who think the anime gets stale as it continues. 
 
The art has me going ""meh."" The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh. 
 
The best part of this anime has to be the characters. Each girl has her own personality... which is great because if they didn't, this anime would have been dumpstered for sure. This is a good tactic because every person has their own preferences. Some like the shy girls, some like the more assertive ones, and some like the mysterious ones. If you asked me how much I liked the girls as the episodes continued on, I would have to respond with a concave up parabola. 
 
Overall, this anime did as well as one based off a visual novel could have done. I'd definitely rather watch this anime than watch a playthrough. An alright anime kept from staleness with its rotating cast of waifus gives Amagami SS a final score of 6.

    ***This is a spoiler free review*** 
 
Story: 9/10 
 
One of my favorite genera for any form of entertainment is romance and when romance is done right, it can be a beautiful thing to encounter. There are however discrepancies between romance anime as some borrow too much from each other and thus become 'generic' or 'stale'. What Amagami SS has done may be too direct of an adaptation from a video game but I beleive that something amazing has been done. Amagami SS takes our male lead Jun'ichi on a trail to relieve his broken heart with many different females to chose from. Where this anime sets off on a different path than others is instead of choosing one female and leaving out the others or in quite the opposite form a harem, the story will reset itself after one successful life has concluded for Jun'ichi. It is quite literally like a dating game in the aspect that you are resetting and starting over. This might be a turn off to some people as each arc covers 4 episodes, resets and starts again but for me it worked very effectively. You might be thinking, ""Well that's awesome and everything but wouldn't this fail if the characters were not interesting?"" The characters will make or break the show for some people as it is entirely up to them to make the show interesting to the audience. I found myself liking all but one of the female leads so in mathematical terms, I liked 5/6th of the show. Each arc is much different in the way the story is approached. One of the arcs had the narrator and the main character conversing together while another arc had a more serious tone. You can quite literally just watch the arc of your favorite character and end the show there. 
 
Animation: 7/10 
 
The animation is about average but stays constant throughout the entire show. Although night scenes seem to stand out more, every arc has the same amount of detail as the one before or after. There are moments however that really shine when they need to such as the moment when Jun'ichi conquers his fear of heights with Kaoru on an observation tower. When the scene continues, it begins to snow and the artwork is stunning. These momentary moments however great do not make up for the sub-par animation the rest of the show presents. The character models are quite good as each female lead has a distinctive look and style that is not repeated for any other characters. 
 
Sound: 6.8/10 
 
The sound is not amazing but gets the job done. Each part of the city is matched with the correct sounding background music that sets the tone for the scenes. The voice acting (Jap. Dubbed) is fairly good with each actor matching the characters well. There is one character however that I just could not stand and thus ruined that particular arc for me.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
 
What romance feeds off of are the characters and how well the audience feels the characters worked with each other. Since each character arc only lasts four episodes, there is a very limited amount of time to set up a back story for each female and make it believable. Every lead in this show seemed like they would actually fall for Jun'ichi and did not seem 'fake' at all. Each character also had their own unique personality which for the most part I loved. Haruka is the school idol and beauty, Kaoru is the childhood friend that has a kinky attitude, Sae is the typical super shy girl that talks with a very soft voice (the character I could not stand), Ai who is the Moe swimmer, Rihoko who is also Jun'ichi's childhood friend has a happy and aloof outlook on life, and Tsukasa who I cannot talk a lot about without spoiling anything. Each character offered something different than the rest. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
 
It's a romance anime biased off of a PlayStation 2 dating sim that in my opinion was done very well. The characters were designed and voiced just right and offered six different high school romances that I loved. It is very hard for me to choose which arc I liked the most which makes it very good overall. To be able to distinguish which part of an anime you like the most is not necessarily a good thing in my opinion. To have an entire show be interesting from start to finish is a pretty hard thing to come by and thus is why Amagami SS receives a 9/10 from me. I strongly recommend this anime to all romance geeks out there. The whole time warp thing that happens at the end of each arc might turn off some watchers but I think if you stick with the show you will not be disappointed. The show is super accessible to anyone as you have a choice of what romance to watch. 
 
If you watched and enjoyed this show move right on to its second season, Amagami SS+ which offers closure for all the characters in a two episodes per character episode arc instead of the four episodes per character arc format in this season. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10

    Let me start by putting it right out there that I am the biggest sucker for romantic anime.  
 
I'm not talking those cheap anime where things end with a 'let's keep being friends' nonsense.  
 
I'm talking real romance anime that actually end with people in an established relationship.  
 
Amagami SS provides this in spades and I fell in love with it immediately. But why exactly do I recommend this anime so highly? 
 
It's not afraid that's why! 
 
This anime uses an Omnibus approach to its story. For example the first 3 episodes the main character turns left and meets girl A. They become attracted to each other and then eventually by the end of the 3rd episode the love is in the air. 
After that 'arc', time resets like a Doctor Who episode and the protagonist takes a different direction and meets girl B. 
 
Amagami uses this effect masterfully and manages to capture the characters so perfectly and realistically.  
 
The protagonist is no pervert nor is he the perfect student or gentleman. He's just an average guy who meets an average girl. 
 
Despite this you can't help but to feel the romance and become invested in each of his paths and resets.  
 
Amagami is one of the few true romance anime out there and I highly recommend it to anyone who is also a sucker for romance.

    This is my first review so i m not sure how these should be exactly written but i guess i will just write how i felt about each of the aspects of the story. When i first saw this anime i thought it was just going to be a harem with a bland story and even blander characters, i was wrong. First of all this is not a harem because its is in an omnibus format, which means the story resets after each of the story's arcs which there are 6 of (one for each of the girls). Each arc contains 4 episodes. 
The story revolves around a high-school boy Junichi Tachibana and how he was stood up for a date 2 years ago which troubles the way he thinks about relationships and also lowers his self esteem a bit, until he meets 1 of the girls in each of the arcs. The way that this anime uses its own omnibus style to break into 6 little arcs and still contain such a great romance in each arc is amazing. The story manages to bring out the emotions of romances that would normally last 3 times the length in each arc in just 4 episodes each arc contains all the characters of the show but still manages to make it so that a good story between Junichi and the girl of the arc happens. 
The characters are great as well, you have the average high-school boy Junichi Tachibana who has problems with self esteem like i mentioned earlier. He is not the typical dense main character you might find in a less well made anime, but neither is he overly likable he is just an average kid who many of us could relate to at that age. None of the girls are bad as well they all have their own lives and their own problems and are not the typical overly affectionate and/or tsundere to the main character, which allows them to be they relateable as well which ends up leading to a more realistic romance which really helps with the story and the romance. A couple of the girls for example are his childhood friend and the most popular girl in school. 
The music of this anime is great in the fact that each girl sings her own version of the theme in the end which is a nice add to each arc. The art of this anime was good as well not the best but certainly not the worst. 
Overall I really enjoyed this show and the only con I could find with it is that it left me wanting more for each story, although this is lessened by the second season of the show Amagami SS Plus which adds 2 episodes to each arc to bring to a total 6 episodes per arc. That sequel is a must watch if you enjoyed Amagami SS. 
In conclusion I really enjoyed this anime and the way it told its story with the omnibus format which allows you to pick your favorite arc and basically choose that as the real story(which might happen after even the first arc). Anyway I hope to see more romance anime with this omnibus style in the future because i thought this was a really unique way of story telling. 
I would highly recommend this show to anyone who loves romance anime.

    in the first episode I was immediately moved to see a lot of good characters in this anime. 
well, I found the rival Kasumigaoka-senpai that is Morishima-senpai, that's my first thought. and continue to the next episode and I immediately down, it turns out the story is quite there ... 
reality is too bitter. * lol 
I am too enthusiastic to equate this story with Kasumigaoka-senpai, my expectations are too high at the beginning and immediately fell just like that. 
 
but the anime Amagami has a really good story, probably because my expectations are too high in the beginning so I review the less interesting. 
 
stories in some female characters always create romantic impressions. although the story is repeated but still can give a different impression. 
 
I should no longer equate Kasumigaoka-senpai again. * sad

         Alright; personally, I've had my fair share of experience in the romance anime department, but this anime was a bit of a different creature for me. Watching an anime in an omnibus format was unexpectedly enjoyable in my opinion, and I had lots of fun watching each of the unique girls develop feelings for this protagonist. 
     So the basic jist of this anime, is that second year high-schooler Junichi Tachibana was stood up on Christmas Eve two years beforehand by an irrelevant character (not sure what the name was but she's mentioned in one of the episodes in the final arc). Knowing this, the anime leads us into a development between the protagonist and six different girls; each with different styles, quirks, and personalities which are able to satisfy everyone. This is also an omnibus anime, meaning that the anime does a ""time loop"", resetting the story and changing who gets together in that arc. 
   Out of all the romance anime I've watched (let's not kid ourselves, it's not really an impressive amount), I was very surprised how enjoyable this format in this anime was for me. Being able to see a fresh new face while keeping the protagonist and relatives consistent made sure that all of the viewers were satisfied, and have made it even to the point where people side towards and have arguments about who the best girl is. 
    The art and sound elements of the anime were up to my expectations, but it wasn't really anything to be praised on. The music was played just at the right moments; and I think that the timing of the music was a decent-sized factor in the whole scheme of things. 
    Moving onto the characters; what can I say? They're six different girls, each with their own personalities and have unique twists as to how their love for Tachibana and their relationship develops. You have types such as the quiet and shy underclassman, the childhood friend, and even an outgoing, teasing upperclassman. This makes it so that everyone has someone to root for; their ""best girl"", and though I can't say I loved all of the girls, that formatting made it very enjoyable for me in my opinion. 
     Let's just say I watched this a little too quickly. Being able to burn through this many episodes, plus the second season, plus the OVAs within a single week is a feat in itself. And that is because I really, genuinely enjoyed watching this anime. Not because it was over the top in any department, but because I really enjoyed seeing the character development between the protagonist and the six different girls. 10/10 from me in that regard. 
  Overall, if you enjoy romance anime or slice of life to any extent, I would definitely give this anime a watch; maybe watch an arc or two to see if you really enjoy this sort of layout. It took some getting used to, having my favourite girl only shown for four episodes sadly, but getting to see the other girls was a nice treat as well. I'm surprised I didn't find this anime quicker; but it's always better late than never.

    Alright Folks! There is one HUGE thing about this anime that will make people love it or hate it, and that's the fact that the whole story 
 
""Repeats after every arc"" 
 
Yes.. after an arc, time shifts back to the night on christmas eve 2 years ago.  however, each arc presents a different girl that the main falls for. 
 
People who like the short romance arcs and a repetition of love with each arc's special twists will enjoy this.  However, people who get bored of watching the same story over and over again will condemn this.  Personally, i like watching each arc, but the repetition of certain events kills me.  Also i find the arcs development a little to quick. 
 
Arts good, not much to say 
 
Sound all depends on your headphones or speakers.  same old same old 
 
Now characters is something i have trouble with.  I find the main character very irratable since he is way too sarcastic and too impulsive.  He acts like his event 2 years ago on christmas eve was the end of his life, and for a while i fails to uplift himself.  however i find the girls personalities quite cliche in a way, but every anime has those types, so i guess its acceptable. 
 
 
Overall i have mixed feelings about this series.  I do enjoy the series of short romances and development, but i do get anoyed by its pace and main character.  I feel like this is a bubbly romantic twist of higurashi, but that's just my opinion

    Amagami............Is one of the strangest  romances in years and that saves it from the inevitable mediocrity.the story is simple 6 six girls 6 four episode arcs each.its  not a harem because he is only romantically involved with one in each arc.The main character for me personally is a highlight because he doees not hesitate. no anos sonos etos stumbling.he is no okazaki from clannad but he is not too average,The girls are some common anime stereotypes but they have  a little extra something that saves them from being too boring.If you want to relax and enjoy a show give this  show a chance

    Hi. This is my first review on MAL, so bear with me if I seem like an amateur, which I am. :D 
 
Story (9) - The story really interested me because from watching other romance animes such as Clannad, I got used to the format of one guy and one girl having a relationship with each other. Upon realizing the format of Amagami SS after Haruka's arc, I was surprised and amazed that this kind of anime exists. The format I'm talking about is called an ""omnibus"", meaning that, for this anime's case, every four episodes, the ""universe"" resets and begins another relationship with the next girl in line for the protagonist. Each story, or ""arc"", was unique and after watching one of them, I was looking forward to the next. 
 
Art (7) - For me, I didn't really notice the difference of art styles from any other slice-of-life high school anime I watched before. It's very generic. But, it is a very minor detail to me personally. 
 
Sound (8) -  The openings are very nice to listen to and the instrumental and/or lyrics can possibly get stuck in your head... well, maybe that's just me. With the endings, what is significant is that every voice actor for every girl did their own ending song for each arc. I thought that was pretty nice instead of just having one ending song for every episode. 
 
Characters (9) - I'll just say you might as well be jealous of the lucky protagonist, Tachibana Junichi. A nice, calm individual who can also be a pervert sometimes due to his shared interest of adult videos and magazines with his best friend Masayoshi Umehara. The personalities of each girl we encounter is unique. For example, Morishima Haruka, the school idol and is very, very energetic. On another hand, we have Nakata Sae, a extremely shy freshman. The different ways each of the girls act give us a different and interesting story each time. 
 
Enjoyment (10) - I really enjoyed this anime. The jokes were pretty funny. The romance scenes were intriguing, the start of having feelings for each other to finally the kiss scenes... I was relieved. The limit of four episodes a girl didn't stop AIC to tell captivating stories between a guy and a girl in a typical high school environment. 
 
Overall (10) - I may be a sucker for romance animes but this one in particular was one of the best I've seen. The distinct format, characters, songs and stories made me want to watch more of it since it was a new experience for me. I would definitely rewatch it. 
 
Also here's my rankings of each of the arcs, if you wanted to know (people will  be giving me strange looks because of this but here you go): 
 
1) Kaoru 
2) Ai 
3) Tsukasa 
4) Haruka 
5) Rihoko (would've been higher but the ending disappointed me) 
6) Sae

    Seeing as the majority of the top reviews are positively directed toward Amagami, I would like to disagree and say this anime was mediocre.   
 
The plot is nothing special, I don't understand why everyone is giving such a high rating for the story.  It's a typical harem romance school anime, but each girl gets her own arc with the main male lead.  I believe that people think that the story is satisfying is because they like to see an anime that shows them all possible outcomes with each female character instead with sticking with one.  In this instance all girls can have a ""happy ending."" This I can thoroughly understand although I still don't see much in the plot it's pretty boring and repetitive.  Guy hangs out with girl, they go on dates and end up in cliche situations, fall in love etc.   
To a younger teenager I can see the appeal of the high school setting and young romance but as a more matured teen individual I was not impressed. Some of the romances were abrupt and unannounced, with no development between the male and the female but nonetheless their relationship works out.   
 
The art is fine, I can't say much about it since it's been a long time since I've watched this anime, but do note that the animation is done sufficiently and fluidly.   
 
I had not problems with the sound it was consistent and did not disappoint.  Again my apologies I can't quite remember much about the audio since it's been a long time after I've watched this anime. 
 
The characters are well....flat.  The male lead was overly awkward and kind of creepy.  His trauma is that he was stood up for a first date with a girl, which is naive and immature if you look at it in a realistic perspective.  He is a pervert no matter how you look at, from my memory I remember he sniffs one of the girl's ankles, or something along that line.  And how the girls tolerate such rudeness and unchivalrous behavior is far beyond my comprehension.  The girls were nothing special as they did not have much character development or change of ideals once their romance flourished with the main male lead.  I couldn't relate to any of the characters and couldn't understand their thought process which made me frustrated with this anime and disappointed. 
 
I don't expect to get a lot of attention and support with this review since this is in fact a negative review, and I can see the majority is leaning toward the more positive side.  Final verdict. If you like romances that actually wrap up and conclude then watch this anime.  Personally I just did not see much in this anime please respect my opinion and I will respect yours.  Thank you for reading.

    Honestly made want the MC to go for a harem ending even though the anime has different arcs! The MC has this way of getting closed off girls to open up. The girls themselves are either extremely cute or very hot! The character development, honestly, could've been better but I still loved it! I loved the soundtracks! Don't get me started on the Opening songs! I loved every single opening even in the second season! The endings changed depending on the arc and what girl it was focused on. This is just me typing random things to fill in the word count. I'm just going to copy and paste these two sentences. This is just me typing random things to fill in the word count.

    Amagami SS is an interesting take on the traditional romance anime; instead of choosing one path and then having to make OVAs for the other paths, why not showcase all of them together! Thus you have a ~26-episode slice of life comedy/romance where Junichi eventually wins the heart of six plus one different girls (plus one because Risa only gets one episode rather than an entire arc, and Junichi already had the heart (in a non-incest way) of his Ni-shi-shi little sister the entire time). 
 
Though it may seem a bit choppy having the main character choose different paths (previous heroines show up as ""cameo"" appearances later), the plot sequence and character development for each arc is superbly done. And as mentioned by previous reviewers, the girls are all very unique so you're bound to find someone to root for. 
 
All in all this is a pretty good romance with a smudging of occasional humor. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is good for its era, with crisp lines and solid coloring. The character designs, like the character personalities, give each heroine a unique style, though all are cute in their own way. My only qualm is that the ""fat"" girl (Rihoko) is still relatively thin by American standards, guess there is a culture gap after all... The actual setting isn't anything all that special, mostly around school with a few deviations. There isn't any particular color emphasis as I guess they were emphasizing the normalcy of it all and how Junichi can be any male viewer, who happened to have been dumped in the past and what not. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs are fairly decent but not so much to be collect worthy. The first OP is a light and playful tune, which is a good fit for the mood in the series. The second OP is a bit more decisive but still relatively light-hearted. Each of the 8 (six main arcs + Risa + Miya) girls has their own ED. The BGM is supportive and fun but nothing that special. What really stands out in this category is the VAs. Itou Shizuka gives so much personality to Haruka that her seductiveness approaches Horo levels at times. Nazuka Kaori also did a great job with Ayatsuji as it must have been very difficult to make her personality switch feel natural. 
 
Story: 
Tachibana has been heartbroken and gf-less for two years, after a date ditched him on their Christmas date. Now he gets a second chance as new encounters with girls abound. You pretty much know what's coming in most of the arcs but how they get there is fairly unique at times and creates some moments of tension (like that feeling in the air before you kiss) that are just great. Some arcs are bound to be better than others, and obviously impressions will be based on personal taste. I liked the Sae arc but my friend skipped the entire thing. Not all paths are linear as well, as Junichi faces significant challenges on the way to winning each girl's heart. 
 
Character: 
The character development is wonderful, and you get a feeling that the character bonds indeed grow as each arc progresses. Tachibana himself is an interesting character has he is somewhat nice and shy at first, typical, but a bit different from normal harem guys in that he can actually make decisions and hard choices. Though I'm not fooling anyone- it's the girls that really define this series. Haruka, Sae, and Ayatsuji were the standouts for me as each have very different tastes and personalities and were just fun to watch as they interacted with Junichi (whose head voice you hear repeatedly through the series). 
 
Value: 
This is a very good light romance watch. You get a believable work with girls slowly liking a guy (w/o the girl vs. girl drama traditionally associated with these) and a very good story progression to go along with it. Add in a nice supporting cast with a interesting sister and you've got yourself a winning package.

    To start off, I might have not given a fair review. I really like Mech's I'm that kind of nerd but at the same time I do not like certain ones. Any ways, I watched this in American and Japanese. The Japanese version is so much better like most animes. Anyways the story line was good, they made some stuff confusing but it was mostly easy to fallow.

    Story:  
It has a lot of ""borrowed elements"" from NGE but that doesn't make it bad. In fact, it has done what NGE failed to accomplish. The only reason why people said it is like NGE is because there is a robot. The starting of the story really made people think that it is like NGE because of a giant robot attacking the city. :P It left me satisfied with its ending. So people who say that it is a ""copycat"" of NGE, you guys are dead wrong. It is not really trying to be deep. It is really just because of the ""foreshadowing"" and the perfectly executed plot. It is not psychological but it is purely sci-fi. 
 
Art: What can I say? Very Good Art is one of its strong points. Especially when the main character is an artist himself. It would be a shame if it has bad art XD The character designs were pleasant to the eye and the mecha designs were one of the most unique I have ever seen because almost every mecha in anime looks humanoid :D 
 
Music: Music being one of its main themes, it is its main point. Music influences the world, not just the in this anime but also applied in the real world. I was really in awe because it is rare to have both the OP and ED to be equally good( Exceptional). No problem here 
 
Characters: The characters really were its strong point. Unlike in NGE where the MC is a sissy, the MC in Rahxephon has a very strong personality. He was confused at first but he faced it like a man.    
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed all the way through. Though it has harem-like elements, you really can't blame the girls because the MC is awesome. He is an artist, good-looking, and he controls the ""Hope of Mankind"" which is the Rahxephon.  
 
Overall: I give it a 10. I admit that EP 1 was not the first episode because I saw it in an anime channel. I downloaded it and I did not regret watching it. So guys try not to think of it deeply because that will really ruin the show for you. So just pay attention to the show because the show has lots of details that should be pieced together in the END!

    I really thought I would love and never forget RahXephon. Being a huge Super Robot fan made me super pumped to watch it. But it didn't really bring anything new to the table. 
 
Characters: 
Too unmemorable for me to have anything to say about them. 
 
Sound: 
Only two memorable tracks: The opening and the ending. But that's only due to listening to them 26 times. The rest of the music was nice to listen to, but forgettable. 
 
Art: 
It's simply nice to look at, but none of the character, mech, or Robeast designs was memorable at all. Same for the background art, which I've seen a million times before. 
 
Story: 
Sure it's a typical Super Robot vs Robeasts series, but the ""mysteries"" between fights are too vague to be interesting. Plus it takes far too long for anything to happen. (""Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah?"" Is anything happening yet?) 
 
Enjoyment: 
Not unwatchable, but not the best. Why was this labeled an action series? I was excited for action, but then it turns out a single episode of Power Rangers had more action than the entirety of RahXephon. That's right. The unmemorable fights are few and far between, the ""mysteries"" weren't interesting at all, and the invincible RahXephon doesn't even have to attack anything for more than 30 seconds. And it ended with both an Anticlimax Boss and a Reset Button Ending, both of which I dislike. 
 
Verdict: Average - go rewatch How To Train Your Dragon instead. That movie has an actual followable plot and an epic climax.

    The main reason why I'm doing this review is to at least try to show that it has NOTHING to do with eva.  
Be aware that the manga, anime and the movie are all different. I recommend you start it with this order: ova-anime-movie-manga. At least, this was the one that worked for me, just change it if you want to.  
Why not the novel? Well, if you'll be able to find it somewhere, then read it after the anime. 
 
STORY 
As you read before, the plot is Terra vs Mulians, the ancient people with blue blood that wants to regain the world from humans, the red blooded people that has their hearts full of despair.  
The story evolves Ayato's being the only pilot for Rahxephon, a god who controls fate but it's main goal is to grant pilot's happiness/desire.  
 
ART  
Oh, the times where anime wasn't full of CG effects and Bones focused more on quality than popularity.  
Besides Rahxephon is from 2002, that are some good animation going on, better than some of these new popular series out there.  
 
SOUND  
Here comes one of the most important parts of Rahxephon, the world needs a retune.  
You will notice that not only the Xephon but also all dolem's have a voice, a tune. Even Quon's urge to create the perfect melody and constantly singing.  
But the main thing here is the soundtrack, search for it and if I'ts possible, read the op and ed lyrics.  
Plus, there's a song called ""The Garden of Everything"" that has a deep connection with Ayato and Reika. 
  
CHARACTERS  
Through the series, the main characters development is pretty clear, there is nothing inexplicable.  
Quon's might be hard to understand if you don't watch the OVA or don't pay attention to her riddles.  
Ayato is definetly one of the most easy to get characters ever. His desire to know himself is completely undertandable, just imagine being at his place.  
Reika is actually the most puzzling. You'll get angry at her during all the series but when you finally read the manga boom, all the answers.  
 
ENJOYMENT  
If you are into drama, romance and psychological anime with some mecha into it, then watch.  
I won't be saying too much here because you probably will say that I'm biased even though I'm being realistic.  
  
Please, be aware that if you come to me talking shit like ""rahxephon is a shitty eva rip-off"" I'll just answer you one thing, watch the fuck out of BOTH SERIES. 
If you read and watch the whole eva and xephon series, you'll understand that IT'S NOT A FUCKING RIP-OFF.   
Bye.

    REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS 
 
This is an anime that I really did not understand nothing in the beggining. You need to really pay attention... it's not an ""easy-to-watch-anime"" or something to pass the time.  
 
It's the kind of anime that you watch to think, or maybe refflect about its story. 
 
So I admit this is not an anime for everybody... especially if you want a spetacular animation (it's not a bad animation, it's actually fine if you consider the time it was made).  
 
But considering the technical aspects it's a BRILLIANT anime. And I did'nt enjoy it too much... it's more like a really deep type of mecha. 
 
So, if you are looking for a reflective, ""hard-to-understand"" and complex mecha, with great characters (main and supporting), RahXephon it's what you're looking for!

    RahXepon was.. something different. Wildly experimental and strikingly abstract, RahXepon shows a great potential in its early episodes. Does it live up to the expectations? Well, not quite. 
 
The show draws a lot of strong influences from other works of art, namely Neon Genesis Evangelion and The Lost Continent of Mu. You can draw many parallels between NGE and RahXepon, that is not to say that RahXepon isn't innovative or original, it is, but with that being said .. 
 
Opening episode starts great. The story kicks off with Tokyo being invaded and our main character Ayato Kamina finding himself in the middle of all of this. While looking for help he encounters his former classmate Mishima Reika, stringing him along a number of puzzling events. He is attacked by government officials and then saved by mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow. The curtain of the ""real world"" Ayato so firmly believed in starts cracking. Why did those government officials have blue blood? What is this strange woman babbling about, how could Tokyo be isolated from the rest of the world by time dilating barrier!? After Ayato is led to a shrine by his classmate Mishima where he awakens the cryptic Xephon, him and Haruka escape through the barrier in to the real world. Like I said, first episode is great, pacing and dynamic are very well done and anime succeeds in grabbing your attention.  
 
After the initial episode, we get episode 2 and anime just kinda.. falls flat on it's face from here on. Honestly, it's full of bad writing and plot holes. The show never really FULLY explains it's mysteries to you. It gives you vague explanations of certain aspects of story and you're supposed to fill in the blanks yourself, I suppose? Big part of anime is the music, but the show never once mentions why is it so important to the Mu (the main antagonist race in the anime). The Mu use Dolems aka weird mecha things as weapons and their main way of dealing with enemies is singing. I get it, they like singing, but after a while it gets kinda boring. It just felt very disappointing that they never explained intentions of Mu, their culture, history, mindset, NOTHING. We learn NOTHING about them. They invaded the Earth, created Tokyo Jupiter and just kinda let go. After killing a billion people or so of course, because aliens are evil and it's only natural for them to be evil.  
Later on in the show we learn about some old guy who apparently created the System of RahXepon and that the world  is supposed to be tuned by instrumentalists, our protagonist and Quon, (again) myterious girl who is same age as Ayato and has the same mark as him on her belly. I'm not going to get too much into this aspect of the story because of the spoilers, but I'll let you know that when you see the ending you'll probably be as disappointed and empty as I did. Once again, the show suffers from major writing issues and felt rushed and forced.  
 
Another major concern I have with the show are the characters. Yeah, some get an alright progression and you can feel attached to them but the cast is just way too big and most of the characters straight up feel unnecessary (I liked the commander though, and his friend with a goatie, they're cool). Midway through the show I honestly felt like I was watching a harem anime. There are like dozen love interests for our lovely protagonist and most of them feel so forced and unnecessary, it's like it's there just to give meaning to the characters, and I straight up hate characters whose only purpose of existing is having a romantic feelings for protagonist, it shows some very lazy writing. Characters could have been a strong point of this anime, but I just can't forgive it for almost turning this into a harem anime, disgusting. 
 
Art is okayish, scenes from Tokyo had a very Serial experiments Lain feeling of aesthetic to them with the vague images and purplish shadows. It strengthens the feeling of mysteriousness which is further amplified by the soundtrack. Oh boy did I love the soundtrack of this anime. Both opening and ending themes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is very pleasant and soothing, it's almost like a serious of lullabies. The ending theme put me to sleep countless time since I have tendencies to watch anime late at night.  
 
Overall, I can't say it was a terrible show because it wasn't. It was a decent show ruined by my own expectations of it, but I just can't shake off the feeling of disappointment when I think about it. It had 26 episodes of airtime and it could have accomplished so much more with the time it had. Would I recommend it? I don't think so. It falls into this niche line of deconstruction shows but it doesn't do a very good job at deconstructing, but that's just my take on the show.

    Beeing heavily inspired by NGE, Rahxephon became one of my favourite 
anime. Though the makers even admitted NGE as their raw model for the 
show, it has enough uniqueness of its own, to stand out from the NGE 
clones of its time. 
 
It`s hard to put a finger on what made the show so special...  
It`s either the extremely complex plot that only 
completely unfolds at the very end or the Mayan mythology inspired 
symbolism that is heavily used in Rahxephon. Nonetheless the show 
creates an unsettling athmosphere throughout its 26 episodes, that is 
only rivaled by NGE itself. 
The characters though are quite different. While Evas cast was almost too human and therefore relatable, Rahxephon makes a totally different approach: Its characters feel 
""strange"", as if they are deeply routed in the shows mystery. It`s 
really hard to describe. 
Nonetheless it is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most unique mecha shows  
out there and should be watched by anyone who wants more from an anime  
than action and fights... It`s an experience you won`t forget.

    As with all series, RahXephon had certain aspects that were truely wonderful and captivating, and some that completely missed the mark. 
 
The story unfolded very nicely throughout most of the series.  Characters were slowly introducted, each given a moment to demonstrate what role they would be playing, perhaps even given some background knowledge.  Each episode covered new, and interesting plot developments, taking its time to explain exactly what was happening, and covering sufficient points to make it all believable.  This all changed somewhere near episode 18 or so.  For whatever reason the enjoyablely comfortable pace which was unfolding before the veiwer rapidly increased and became very confusing.  Characters actions became far-fetched, absurd, and nonsensical.  The plot was rushed and nothing was explained.  What was once close to being a perfect anime, crumbled away to medeorcrisy. 
 
The characters themself were all extremely thought out.  Our protaganist, young Ayato, your average high school kid, is thrust into an unbelievable situation which he has no control over.  Everything he has ever known and learned to believe has been chalked up to lies and fantasies, and now he must learn some hard truths while dealing with it all.  All he can really do is go along with it and hope things work out.  His main responsibility consists of piloting the RahXephon, a giant mecha which only he can manouver.  He is complimented by an arsenal of military men and women, a small number of friends, and a mother.  All have a certain role which they are doted with an each play that role very well. 
 
The art is a very simple, very clean, 90's style of animation.  It's honest beauty is unparalled with todays standards, but in my opinion, there is absolutly nothing wrong with it.  It's perfect.  The character designs were unique and not overused.  The costumes had a certain chic futuristic look.  The backgrounds were swarming with small details that tied entire scenes together.  And the camera angles captivated me and left me wanting more.  All in all, one of this series best qualitities. 
 
My favorite aspect of this series, however, were RahXephon's enemy.  The D1 are one of the things that I found were rushed and not explained properly.  This being said, each one was designed and drawn perfectly.  Each one was completely original.  And when each one ""sang"", with its mouth gaping open, its eyes poppping from its sockets or squeezed shut, its face distorted, it transformed into an unimaginablly frightening (literally) experiance.  And its shrill voice topped it off like nothing I have ever experienced.  I want to give the guy or girl who developed those mecha beasts a huge hug and tell them that what they did changed me.  They are THAT cool. 
 
Other then the confusing and rushed plot during the last 8-10 episodes, and the very confusing last epiosde, I would say that I really liked the series.  I tried to keep pace with what was going on during those last few, but in the end I just sat back and took it at face value.  The interesting characters, classic art style, beautifully rendered BGM, excellent voice acting, and certainly the D1 enemy made this not only an enjoyable watch but one I would highly recommend.

    I have heard of this series being compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion as its counterpart or rival, although I also see it as being a starter or growing plan of other BONES’ series such as Eureka Seven & Xam’d Last Memories and also that RahXephon has its share of being close to the aforementioned series but it is far from that to what I watched. There is also the fact that the director of the series Yutaka Izubuchi has worked with Hideaki Anno on a few projects together and he helped with the design drafts of the EVA units. 
 
In a world where time passes at a crawl and the blood of your neighbor runs blue, 17 year old high school student Ayato Kamina goes about his daily life within Tokyo Jupiter oblivious to the world around him, having been educated with the fact that the all civilization but Tokyo has been destroyed. But all that changes when the mysterious civilization ""MU"" invades his home, raining destruction down from the sky in the form of strange monsters called Dolems. The events that occur next will lead Ayato to the mysterious woman named Reika Mishima, to the truth of their existence, the discovery of what and who he is, and to the powerful angelic robot RahXephon. 
 
Like I said, the plot, premise, and even the characters is almost similar to EVA although it manages to not mess up or try to make it sound artsy or too pretentious whenever they run out of story ideas, albeit EVA was more of a parody/psychological breakdown of the genre. There is the plotline of being in a war using giant mechas piloted by teenagers to battle with and also the utopian/dystopian element where Kamina discovers that the world he’s been in for so long is not what it seems, with the “humans” in Tokyo Jupiter bleeding blue blood instead of red. Maybe the story isn’t as original and being like NGE, but it is a straight-up mecha anime story that is actually played off well and something that I saw myself liking, much like watching Eureka Seven for the first time. 
 
The characters are ranges from being well-developed and semi-interesting, although I will say once again, the character traits have an EVA feel to this, but I’m proud to say that the main character Kamina Ayato is not a Shinji Ikari as you do feel for him when he discovers his whole world is a lie and how would you react, plus it helps that he isn’t a whiner most of the time. I will say that Haruka Shitow is exactly like Misato Katsuragi for being the older motherly figure to Kamina but has some problems of her own, too, and there’s her sister Megumi, which I would say have some similar features to Asuka, but thankfully, not that much as she gotten to be less annoying and more relatable throughout the series. I really can’t tell who the Rei Ayanami of this show is basically either Reika Mishima or Kuon “Quon” Kisaragi as both happened to be silent and stoic figures of the show. There are also Kamina’s friends at Tokyo Jupiter Hiroko Asahina and Mamoru Torigai, who are also more messed up than him ever since he left as one of them discovers the truth for them and that one of them is quite a prick (Try and guess who I am talking about). 
 
The animation by BONES is now quite dated with its’ character and mecha designs, being made in the early 2000s, 5 years after EVA, and for what it was, it had great animation for the time being with the art style and colors being muted. Musically, it was rather good to an extent; the background music can get a bit repetitive but sometimes I don’t even notice it that much but I really do love the opening theme for show, “Hemisphere” which was produced by Yoko Kanno but sadly, that’s the only thing she handled in the music department and the ending theme was very silent-sounding and docile but I happened to think it somewhat fits well into the show. 
 
The ADV Films dub was actually an okay dub with some overacting in some parts. I really did like Chris Patton’s performance as Kamina Ayato and I can see why the guy is a great voice actor as he played someone that would act realistic in a situation of crazy proportions. I’ll say Monica Rial was good in her role as Haruka but whenever it’s her cue to react or scream at something, it pierces into overacting a little and yes, I will mention that Vic Mignogna is also a part of the dub and he was an alright addition as capturing the prick nature in Mamoru. 
 
FINAL VERDICT: All-in-all, Rahxephon is something that I would watch and actually recommend over Neon Genesis Evangelion as this actually goes into that territory without having to stoop into being overly pretentious although Rahxephon is guilty of being like that sometimes.

    I'm going to assume that you know how many people have compared this series to Neon Genesis Evangelion due to their similarities. I watched Evangelion before this, although I did so years ago, if you're curious. In the end, I did somewhat regret watching this series after Evangelion, on which I'll elaborate more on at the end of this review. 
 
I'll also try to make this spoiler-free. 
 
Story 
This is, in my opinion, the weakest part of RahXephon. The story was a bit too complex for me, as there were many subtle allusions to events in the characters' past throughout, and I had trouble keeping track of them. By the end of the series, I had forgotten about most of them due to my emotional involvement in the series, which ultimately triumphed over my intellectual involvement. This is the first thing to keep in mind: RahXephon will require quite a bit of thinking if you want to uncover all the mysteries in the plot, some of which weren't solved by the end (I'll probably have to watch it a second time). However, the story's complexity does provide some depth. The plot builds up to the  ending very nicely, although the ending itself was rather frustrating for me, as I found it contradictory of events earlier in the story. It didn't ruin the series, but it made RahXephon's place in my memory much less secure. 
 
Art 
Considering how old RahXephon is, the art is fantastic. Everything, especially the mechas, is given a lot of detail, and the landscapes contribute to the atmosphere quite nicely. 
 
Sound - English subs 
The music is varied, blending jazz, classical, and other styles. The soundtracks are wonderful, and like the art, they complement the atmosphere very nicely. The voice acting is great, and the characters sang nicely. 
 
Character 
The characters are, for the most part, very good. Ayato is given lots and lots of development, as is the case with most of the other characters. The story's complexity enriches them and gives them a lot of background, which is nice since it renders them not one-dimensional. There are lots of emotional struggles that give the series lots of meaning. 
 
Enjoyment 
This was mainly influenced by the story's ending and how it didn't fit into the series as well as it could have. However, I did very much enjoy the moments leading up to it, and RahXephon had no problem in rousing the same nihilism in me as Evangelion did. 
 
Since the makers did decide to take a lot of ideas from a classic like Evangelion, I thought it would be unfair to judge RahXephon as I would normally. Instead, I unconsciously raised my standards significantly so that RahXephon wouldn't just get the easy way out from copying Evangelion. This was for me the only option besides considering it a complete ripoff and not watching it. In the end, I felt that RahXephon fell short of those standards since it didn't elaborate enough on the parts it took from Evangelion or present enough new material to be considered unique from Evangelion. However, the ratings in this review were made without this in mind, since I felt that the makers at least made a legitimate attempt in creating something new. Had I decided to factor in Evangelion's influence, these ratings would likely have been lower. 
 
Finally, I conclude that RahXephon is an earnest but misdirected attempt at setting a new standard in the mecha genre of anime. Despite its similarity to Evangelion, I would at least give it a try, as it does have its own artistic merits.

    Rahxephon is an entry in the super robot genre of mecha anime focused on teenager Ayato Kamina coming to realize his seemingly ordinary life is a complete fabrication when he is caught in the middle of a conflict between the blue-blooded Mulian race and a military organization known as TERRA fighting to oppose their attempts to take over the world. Becoming the chosen pilot of the mecha Rahxephon,  Ayato fights to protect humanity against the Mulian threat while trying to make sense of what is real to him and who he can trust in a crisis where he feels like a pawn to both sides fighting in the conflict. 
 
Before I get going on the review, I should address one infamous bit of contention that older mecha anime fans usually go off about and that is accusing Rahxephon of being an Evangelion ripoff. While there are a number of scenes in Rahxephon similar to being depicted in Eva, said similarities are mostly superficial as there is a difference in moods and themes depicted between both titles. Eva milks Kaballah and Judeo-Christian imagery while dabbling into psychological insight with the problems facing its major characters and relishing in the dysfunction and despair faced by them. On the other hand, Rahxephon dabbles into music and Mayan lore for its plot elements and has themes more focused around revelation and transcendence. In spite of some similarities, both titles are completely different beasts for mecha anime and it is not that uncommon for mecha anime to utilize character and plot cliches found from past titles of the genre. 
 
Setting aside that sordid matter, Rahxephon is primarily focused on Ayato's character as he tries making sense of what is a truth and a lie with his life as he tries determining who among the Mulians and TERRA he should trust. The series drops hints of many of the characters that he interact with having past connections to him or having ulterior motives for needing him. Understandably, Ayato does find himself quite angry and frustrated at points as he tries making sense of his predicament and coming to his own answers with what he should do in his situation. His quest to uncover what is real to him leads him to clash with both factions throughout the series as he tries to understand what he should believe in and learning who he can legitimately trust. 
 
Besides Ayato, Rahxephon offers up a good deal of exploration of its futuristic world and characters. The series has a large cast of characters among both humanity and the Mulians who get fleshing out to understand their motives for engaging in battle with one another and what they seek from our male lead, notably Haruka Shitow who is shown to have strong emotions for our male lead and several factions attempting to manipulate events to benefit their goals. In addition, the series explores a good deal of the phenomena and technologies utilized among the characters, most notably the Tokyo Jupiter phenomena that the Mulians are isolated in and the mysterious Reika Mishima sharing some sort of bond to the Rahxephon. The series slowly unveils more to its characters and world as it progresses and helps add more to the complex mystery it offers up with what purpose Ayato has to both TERRA and the Mulians and builds up to an epic-filled ending that neatly wraps up many of its lingering plot developments. 
 
Praises aside, Rahxephon does still run into its occasional bumps in quality. The first few episodes are a bit slow in their buildup as Ayato learns about his predicament while still inside Tokyo Jupiter, which may turn off first-time viewers of the series. Also, the series is still prone to some of the common flaws of many mecha anime titles as the first half of it squanders episodes on “monster of the week” plots with the Dolems deployed by the Mulians and the Rahxephon mecha not being too seriously challenged by many threats that it confronts, killing any sense of conflict and suspense out of any fight scenes that the mecha gets involved in. 
 
For its time, Rahxephon was a gorgeous series to look at as it sported beautiful scenic shots, vivid color and a rich amount of detail put into characters, mecha and scenery. Animation for the series was above average in quality for its time as the series sported a number of elaborate animated sequences involving the various mecha fights and some visual effects milked at a number of points to show off the bafflement and confusion that Ayato undergoes when encountering a Dolem or the mysterious Reika Mishima.  
 
On the musical end, Rahxephon sports a strong soundtrack offered through both Yoko Kanno's composition and Ichiko Matsumoto's vocal performances. With a mix of intense and hauntingly powerful musical tracks, the soundtrack is very fitting for the complicated and dramatic plot that the series offers up. 
 
Overall, Rahxephon is a mostly well-executed mecha title that dabbles into existential drama and romance in its focus on Ayato's struggles. In spite of a few hiccups, the series offers a unique storytelling experience and strong presentation that will leave you hooked on it from start to finish.

    I think I stumbled upon RahXephon from a review of Neon Genesis Evangelon where someone said if you didn't really like NGE you'd probably like RahXephon.  That advice was perfect for me. 
 
All in all, the characters and story really made it for me.  The characters and their decisions were believable and you go through a good range of emotions while watching it.

    This is my first anime review, although I've watched many anime. So I apologize if spoilers might have crept in this review unknowingly.What are we waiting for? Lets get to the review! 
 
STORY: (8.2/10) 
Many say that this anime is rip off of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is true that the latter served as an inspiration to Rahxephon and the theme of anime seem to be similar, that is ""aliens invading earth and protagonist having a key role in retuning the world"". There ends the similarities. 
 
Rahxephon, it is an exhilarating admixture of suspense,action,romance,science fiction and psychological elements. The way the plot is portrayed, its like the various events which have a very intimate connection, yet you wont feel any connection at all until the last part of the last episode. 
 
I cannot comment about the story much without spoiling.Even a small slip up from me results in disastrous spoiler! 
 
I don't know why many people say something like, 
 
 ""For instance, all these weird looking mechas sing. It's part of the story; I get that much. But after a while; after hearing them singing over and over, episode in and out with that weird noise. It annoys you, irritates you and pretty much 'forces' you to skip that part."" 
 
If you don't like mecha genre don't watch that anime in the first place. Don't just say that anime is horrible/bad just because it does not suit your genre. Judge anime by its plot,the way the plot is portrayed. If you can't understand the anime then it is your problem. 
 
And those mechas singing, it is the basic physics. Even in real world some singers can shatter glass by singing at high pitch and frequency. If a high pitch and high frequency sound can shatter a glass, then why not it can be used in war? With some modifications ,of course. That's the basic idea behind those mechas singing. 
 
The way the story is portrayed, the way various elements like dolems (golem) were introduced, depict that the author had done a great deal of work in learning ancient history and myths, their literature, art and culture. 
 
In a bottom line the concept behind the story is excellent.The story is good.It always keeps you on edge.Its mysterious too. But it is not some thing you can call a masterpiece. Still it is good. 
 
MUSIC: (9.4/10) 
Music in this anime is top class.It is alluring,captivating yet with slight melancholic taste.The opening theme.....lets just say....it  is in a league of its own.The moment you hear that captivating music,those alluring yet deep lyrics,your heart will undergo various phases of emotions. 
 
ART: (9.1/10) 
Art is quite good. Its eye catching sceneries, mystical sculptures of Mu really captivates your attention. 
 
CHARACTER: (6.2/10) 
Portraying the feelings of characters,particularly in romance is one of the areas where this anime needs improvement. 
 
How can a girl who has deep romantic feelings over one boy dates other? Also how can a girl who has feelings over one boy instantly switches to other? 
 
I won't mention the names of those characters, as it might spoil the suspense, but those who have watched the anime might get what I mean.  
 
I like the serious demeanor that prevails over TERRA members but don't you think it is too serious? 
 
There are similar flaws like these in character development.Other that that the character development is fair. 
 
ENJOYMENT (8.8/10) 
 
This anime really kept me on edge. I really enjoyed the anime except at the last part in which ................let me be blunt here.....there is intercourse between two mechas .It is not shown but it is implied.....That peeved me a lot. 
 
OVERALL (8.5) 
 
Overall this anime is good but not in the level of masterpiece.

    It's my intention to make this review more helpful, so I will devote three sections for different purposes. 
-Reasons why Amagami SS might not be for you 
-Detailed Review 
-Tips while watching 
I'll also keep this review spoiler free. 
 
First off, Amagami SS (ASS from now on), like any other anime is not for everyone, so it'll be up to you whether you watch it or not, but before you do let me guide you so you know if you might enjoy it. 
You shouldn't watch ASS if you dislike: 
-Romance anime 
-Non harem animes (there are several main love interests, but they don't occur simultaneously) 
-Non ecchi animes 
-Omnibus styled anime 
-Male lead character 
-Vulnerable lead 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Being done with that, let me review each aspect of the anime separately. 
 
Story: 
I've grown more and more respectful of animes based off visual novels, and their story is the main cause. This is because the stories of animes of this kind have very definite plot points and a very clear direction, never falling into filler chapters, not even filler sequences, let alone arcs. That said, ASS has a strong plot for each story arc, probably because any visual novel without a strong plot would bore the player, save for an eroge perhaps. summarised, its the love story of main character Tachibana Junichi and six other girls, which each get their separate version of the story. What I really liked about ASS, other than its exceptional (its literal meaning 'an exception') straightforwardness, was its potential to be different. What potential? you may wonder, what I mean, is that there are actually 720 different ways to watch ASS! Truth is I ran into it when I was in need of a change, an it was that broadness of possibilities that motivated me to watch the series as fast as I did (I finished it in 2 days, something I hadn't done in a veeeery long time). Now you may say, 'no way, you're stupid, there isn't a chance for a series to be watched 720 different ways', and you would be mistaken, because what I mean by that is that you can start with whatever arc you please and go on with any other. There being six different arcs, that is actually a bunch of different orders to follow, which is not that breathtaking, but it was a welcome change for me, and chances are, if you've watched as much anime as I have, it might be a pleasant one for you too. So I dare you to ignore the episode order and do whatever you want if you are gonna watch ASS (keep in mind that arcs are 4 chapters each plus a bonus so arc one starts ep. 1, arc two starts ep. 5, three is ep. 9, four ep. 13, five ep. 17, six starts ep. 20, and ep. 25 is a bonus; basically (4 x arc number) + 1). 
 
Art: 
Art was decent, visual quality is generic (again literally 'like that of its genre') but competitive, and well done; what I was thankful for was that each female character had a distinct design which was thoughtfully fitted to their personality in my opinion. 
 
Sound: 
Here I was very impressed, rarely had I seen an anime with so many endings in such a short airing time, accounting 7 endings through 25 episodes, summed up with 2 openings, all of which were very decent. 
 
Characters: 
ASS' characters are, like its story, very well defined and properly thought out, as I said, their design is individual, although it might seem 'futsū 普通' due to all of the other school anime around, its praise worthy that each has their personality and reacts in what I thought were more human and grown up ways, except perhaps for Junichi's sister, who was sadly unable to get an arc of herself xP. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I loved watching through this show, partly because I'm a very corny fellow, but also because it brought me new faith in anime I had not discovered and that I might enjoy just as much. With luck it may do the same for you if you happen to watch it. I do think though, that my case was very particular, so it's best if you keep your expectations somewhat lower. 
 
Overall: 
I give Story a 9, for its possibilities, Art an 8 for its professional quality, Sound an 8 for the resources invested, Characters a 9 for the solidity and individuality and Enjoyment a 10 for... well, for enjoyment xD. That averages 8.8, which rounds up to 9. 
 
------------------------------------------------------ 
 
Tips: 
-Take your chance and watch it differently 
-Take a break between arcs 
-Have patience with the MC, who starts up all pathetic at the beginning of each arc 
-Watch it subbed xD 
 
 
That's it for my review, I hope you found it useful, and if there is something you think is wrong or needs discussion feel free to leave a comment about it on my page.

    Amagami SS is an anime that could have been much better if it wasn't for the fact that it's a series broken up into short, rushed arcs that don't really deliver the full potential of the story. I feel a great opportunity has been squandered here as out of all the romance animes I've watched Amagami SS certainly takes a more realistic approach to romance and its portrayal of the characters is more in line with what you'd see in reality.  
 
The whole story in Amagami SS pivots around 2 central points. 1.) The male lead, Junichi Tachibana, got his heart broken on a christmas eve 2 years before the start of this series and 2.) he's really desperate for a girlfriend.  
 
These two points will reoccur in each chapter and will be the catalyst for a possible relationship between him and each of the featured heroines. But here's the problem - this series features 6 main heroines and there's only 25 episodes. Rounded, that's 4 episodes per heroine and that's just not enough to build any suspense or expectation in the watcher. Some arcs (especially Sae's) feel contrived rather than natural. The romance doesn't progress in a fluid kind of way. Rather, the male lead and his romantic interest are introduced to each other in the 1st episode of the arc as strangers and in the next the watcher is already expected to treat them as a couple. 
 
That said, I fully realise that this is an adaptation of a dating game and the studio still did a good job with the story they had to work with. To counterbalance the above paragraph I can think of a couple of things that actually make Amagami SS unique and worth watching: 
 
Firstly, I welcome this anime's portrayal of female characters. You won't find a single green, blue, purple or pink haired woman in this whole series. Most characters in this series have black hair. Indeed, Amagami SS portrays our Japanese counterparts in a more realistic light. This whole anime gimmick of seeing females with hair colour spanning the entire length of the visible spectrum can get old at times.  
 
Secondly, the characters' personalities are also more like what you'd expect in reality. The female cast isn't full of brainless zombies waiting to be scooped up by the horny male lead as if it was ""forget your pants"" day and they just happened to get their heads stuck in a manhole. No, the female characters here have substance and certain strength that certainly relates to reality. They crack perverted jokes, burp, get clingy, stuff themselves with doughnuts and just generally resemble the women I'm used to seeing at my university. This is a very strong aspect of this series. If you're also tired of seeing the stereotypical idealised anime females who for some mysterious reason do not posses a single masculine feature and never feel the need to fart - this anime is certainly up your alley.  
 
Lastly the art and sound are both extremely good. The animation is fluid, high in quality and crisp. The OST features some really emotional pieces which fits in well with this type of anime. Another interesting feature is that all heroines have their own ending song making each arc seem more personal. 
 
The enjoyment section is the more complicated part of this review. I enjoyed this anime, don't get me wrong and it is certainly good but I felt that it had more to offer. I can't really give it anything more than a 7. Each arc is way too rushed and in the end the romance aspect feels contrived.  
 
Had the studio focused on maybe 2-3 heroines and gave them more episodes to actually build up more to each climax, I would have probably given this anime a very solid 9. But it is a dating game adaptation after all and they still did a decent job. 
 
All in all, 7 points.

    (Note: This review covers both this season and the second season, Amagami SS+ Plus.) 
 
In reality, it's not possible to date multiple girls at once.... at least, not if you don't want to be seen by society in a bad light as a cheater. However, if you're not dating your girlfriend but instead a different girl in an alternate universe, you're not cheating on her, right? This is the case with a man like Junichi Tachibana; in different alternate universes, he's giving a different girl the love she deserves, and if you think about it, everyone's happy that way. A few years ago, I watched an anime called ""Photo Kano"", and while I can't say I disliked that anime, I was oblivious to the omnibus format it held until it was too late. For that reason, when I found out that this particular anime, which aired years before it, was pretty much the same, I was ready to take it on; however, I wasn't ready for exactly how good it was. 
 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, get ready to hear my thoughts on such an anime, ""Amagami SS"", which was originally called just ""Amagami"". (I don't know why the SS was added, but whatever!) 
 
Amagami SS generally follows the romantic misadventures of Junichi Tachibana, a (kind of perverted) high school student. Two years prior, his heart was broken by a girl who never showed up for a date on Christmas Eve; because of that, he is distrustful when it comes to relationships. However, in each arc of this anime, one of six girls manages to change his minds; these six girls are Haruka Morishima (an eccentric senpai), Kaoru Tanamachi (a classmate and good friend), Sae Nakata (a shy underclassman), Ai Nanasaki (an underclassman on the swim team), Rihoko Sakurai (Junichi's childhood friend), and Tsukasa Ayatsuji (the hardworking class rep). In four episodes of season one and two episodes of season two each (making a total of six episodes each), we get to see how the relationship between Junichi and one of these girls develops. 
 
The story arcs of Amagami SS would be either a hit or a miss, but luckily, there's more ""hits"" than ""misses""; even though not all of the arcs are great, it was interesting to see how each of the girls' characters would develop in each arc. There is a great number of enjoyable side characters, with one of my favorites being Umehara, Junichi's best friend; he is a ""goofy, pervy friend"" kind of character done right, and some of his actions have proved how true of a friend he is to Junichi. However, this series truly wouldn't be as great as it is without its heroines; all of them are fun in their own way, with two of my favorites being Haruka and Tsukasa. Haruka is definitely a favorite, as she has a great personality, great looks (I can't believe I just said that either), and a great arc in both the first and second seasons; on the other hand, while Tsukasa seems like a kind, hardworking girl on the outside.... well, without giving too much away, I'm just going to say I was kind of surprised by her revelation and loved the character development she was given. The only heroine I kind of didn't like was Risa Kamizaki; while I could honestly see her good intentions, it's hard to truly forgive her actions, and I have a hard time believing her relationship with Junichi, with the fact that she only got one episode in the first season not helping. 
 
The animation for Amagami SS isn't the best, but it's definitely serene animation with solid character designs. I know that I keep saying this, but I'll say it again; AIC did a great job with the animation with this anime. There are also some solid voice actors working on this anime, and they did a great job, as always. The three opening themes, ""i Love"", ""Kimi no Mama de"", and ""Check My Soul"" all by azusa, are catchy, upbeat songs that I really liked. The first season had a variety of different ending themes for each girl, with most of them being great and my favorite being ""Koi wa Aserazu"", the ending theme for Rihoko's arc. However, in the second season, there is instead only one ending theme for the whole season, ""Kokuhaku"" by azusa; the fact that the different ending theme per arc thing isn't done again is a bit disheartening, but the song itself is quite serene. 
 
It's not just the huge majority of ending themes that makes Amagami SS enjoyable, though; it's everything I have just mentioned. If you're tired of your ""best girl"" not winning the heart of the protagonist in harem anime, I'd recommend you to watch this. After all, this is one anime where everyone wins!

    This show was so bad, so why did I enjoy it so much? Ignoring all the other bad shows I've liked, it's probably because I watch anime to be entertained and so I can ignore a lot of faults. I'll try my best to give a solid review here. 
 
Story: 
There wasn't much in terms of an over-arching story because the show is broken up into 4-5 episode chunks focusing on one heroine and then resetting back to ground zero once that arc wraps up. Individually, each arc has a nice story to it but between dialogue and everything, it feels like watching a Let's Play of the dating sim. Dialogue is so bad. I swear, I've never played the game but I feel like I know exactly what it would be like with the skipping from location to location to have a conversation that progresses flags that was depicted in the anime. I guess it's hard to explain. My favorite episodes had to have been the last two because in the timelines for the last two, we see him having those sort of events with all the other heroines in the same timeline, which is what I expected from the show in the first place. There is very little interaction with each heroine during another's arc but in the last two, he was getting along with all of them at the same time and it felt more natural I guess. The upside to the way it was formatted was it didn't have to deal with an issue like other harem shows such as nisekoi when only one of them can win and be cannon in the end. In this one, no matter who you think best girl is, you'll have a cannon relationship ending for them. Imagine if nisekoi had arcs where raku and whatever girl had no interference and could develop a relationship and every shipper could be happy because rakuXgorilla trash could be cannon AND RakuXbest girl Onodera could be cannon! Anyway, that last comment was neither here nor there. 
 
Art:  
Not bad. Not amazing. ""Good"" 
 
Sound: 
It feels like music from a dating sim. that's all I got. 
 
Character: 
I'll be honest, I liked most of the characters. Our main man was sort of well, a common harem protagonist but it was interesting seeing the slight changes in him depending on which girl he was focused on. They were very little but for example, he mustered up the courage to ask morishima out multiple times because her character's nature demanded a man who could surprise her and sweep her off her feet. (She's asked out all the time but no one has ever wanted her badly enough to risk the humiliation of being rejected twice!) but Sae did nothing to our MC so he stayed very timid (maybe even got more timid) and had to tell himself over and over that he had to be the one to confess to her. Ayatsuji was definitely my favorite because she had to wear a mask and I like the ones that seem sweet but will bury you (Am I messed up in the head? Nadeko is also best monogatari girl for that reason haha) The format (Arcs that reset each time as mentioned in the story portion) was rough on all these characters though because the fact they didn't have time to really be fleshed out made ALL of them feel sort of bland. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I was kept amused. The show was so bad but I enjoyed watching it despite that so I give that an 8. I'm not a critic so I can overlook all those issues that other people get tied up on (as long as they aren't REALLY bad) and just enjoy a show. I'm not proud to admit I enjoyed a lot of bad shows but my enjoyment isn't affected as much by poor scripting and pacing as the next guy. (Brynhldr had god awful pacing at the end and it was bad enough to hurt my enjoyment but it's gotta be really bad like 60 god damn chapters adapted in the last 2-3 episodes bad.)

    As already mentieoned in the synopsis, we get an adaption of a dating sim in which there is one MC, who decides between six girls everytime a new arc is introduced. 
By doing so, the anime covers up many preferences which is, without a doubt, one of the good aspects of this series. 
 
As mentioned above, this anime consists of six romantic short-stories plus one additional short-story in which the MC did not decide for one of the six main female characters . 
 
These six women/girls all show different character traits, hence each short-story is kind of unique judging from the overall atmosphere and process, though the outcome keeps most of the time the same. 
 
Nevertheless, by having only short-stories, the series is kind of limited compared to other romantic animes due to the amount of stories. 
Each short-story consists of only four episodes which does not leave much room for experiments. 
However, most of the arcs are still quiet enjoyable, even if you´ll hardly ever enjoy all six stories equally. 
Fortunately, there is a Sequel called Amagami SS plus which continues the same stories from where they stopped  
 
Most of the characters are nothing too special, for example, we got the dense main character Tachibana who is slightly perverted, as well as his best friend who is mostly the same. 
As for the women, there are stereotypes like the childhood friend with a crush on the main character and the shy and silent girl with big boobs. 
Though these characters are nothing special, it is still good to have them due to the variety of love-stories, after all there still are more characters who are at least a bit one-of-a-kind. 
 
Talking about the art/style of the series, there is not much to say, personally, I like it but that's up to everyone to decide. 
 
All things considered, I had quiet some fun with Amagami SS, it may not be a masterpiece but  it gave me a good time and many enjoyable romantic moments and that's all I asked for.  
 
Overall: 8/10

    (This review will only help people how are planing or have watch this anime, and is just to help them understand the format/style of this anime series.) 
This is the first romance anime that was adapted from a game and they made it right. Now Amagami SS takes the game and maked it the anime series it self. There are six girls and each girls have four episodes that the main character builds up their relationship and after that four episode the next girl will continue from scratch. It kind of sounds bad but its not, this makes this series the best and unique this 2010. This is not harem and when the main character starts with another girl the previous one will not affect the new relationship because of the special build of the series it self. 
 
I wont say that this is an outstanding anime of romance animee genre but its unique style makes it one of the greatest series of 2010 for me. Just remember that this is no a harem anime because at the end of each four episode the main character and the heroin ends up with one another. 
 
Hope that this helps and I will see you guys next time.

    Amagami SS is an anime adaption of a PS2 Dating Sim, much like in the game the main character can choose who to pursue, in this anime series they have tried to show every female protagonist in a few shorts Arcs, each arc will center around Tachibana Junichi trying to forgot his past of being stood up on Christmas Eve and finding love, each arc focusing on Tachibana trying to find love with the different women in his life. 
 
Its very hard to rate a whole series as it doesnt feel like one its just an anime of short stories, so what i will do is not rate the WHOLE series but each arc. 
 
As a whole this series it basically hit and miss some arcs were extremely well done, some felt rushed compaired to the other arcs, i think as a whole i loved this series and i am a fan of the arc system it gave a different perspective how life COULD of gone for Junichi which is rare to see in some animes. 
 
With the upcoming 6 Episode OVA i hope it continues from the Special episode (ep 25), also there is a special Arc 1 episode involving his SISTER :O 
So this series has everything you look for in a Romance, various of different kind of persionalities and endings. 
 
 
Spoliers Ahead (i will try not to say too much that will spoli it for you) 
All the arcs are in order! 
 
 
 
Haruka ""Lovely"" Morishima Arc: 
 
Not one of my favorites, Haruka is built as the most beautiful girl at Tachibana's school, the whole arc just didnt feel right from her being distant to quickly realising she was in love with Junichi, the pacing was a little off as the first ep or so felt fine they will starting to become friends then BAM its the last episode and then they both share there feelings for one another, it just didnt feel right it would of took alot longer for her to get to love him, the whole arc to me didnt feel right and felt like it was TOO much of a miss match character wise. 
6/10 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi Arc: 
 
Kaoru is a friend of Junichi in his class, the question of if Kaoru loves Junichi is a little questionable but after a while it grows and that progression was nice to see the whole turning from Friends to Lovers was one that is very believable and the way Kaoru was always a little defensive made this arc very special. 
8.5/10 
 
Sae Nakata Arc: 
 
Ah Sae this very scared girl who is in Junichi's sister's year, he starts helping her to get over her Nerves, The whole part of Junichi helping her felt strange i know he is suppost to be a nice guy but helping this random person out felt a little strange but once you got over her ANNOYING quiet voice you will grow to love this arc, to me it was one of the better ones and was paced correctoly throughtout it had enough of episodes to get across what was needed. 
8.5/10 
 
Ai Nanasaki Arc: 
 
A friend of Junichi's sister once again, Ai is on the swim team and most of the things in this arc usually focus on that. Ai is very quiet to start with and grows with confidence which was nice to see, the pacing was good it didnt feel too fast or too slow, and her as a character and Tachibana seem very believable, a very good arc in its right just not the best. 
7.5/10 
 
Rihoko Sakurai Arc: 
 
Ah Rihoko the childhood friend,very clumsy girl with a bad habit of eating alot, this arc made me smile the whole way through, the arc didnt rely on humour but the way its in the series and the way they explain her true feelings towards Junichi but being his ""Childhood Friend"" Junichi can only see her as a friend, again a very believable story and this is the only arc i REALLY wanted her and Junichi to begin going out and the way it ends made it feel a little sad, this arc had everything you wanted and tbh THIS could of been the whole show. 
9/10 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji Arc: 
 
VERY different from the others, all other female leads up to now were all very cute/nice and at the start this is was Tsukasa started off like but then Junichi saw a very different style to her, she was like Jeckyl and Hyde type of person one very nice one very nasty and was interesting to see how Junichi would cope, this arc caught me off guard, i wasnt expecting her to be like that and it kind of confused me to if i liked the arc or not? after thinking over it i fell Tsukasa's arc was good, different but good. 
6.5/10 
 
Risa Kamizaki (Special) Arc: 
 
Risa is 100% Stalker but her brutal honesty came through to Junichi you see from her perspective how his relations have gone with all the previous females, all of them in this arc ending with Risa telling them a lie. 
This is a one episode arc but it left questions still unanswered, it felt they cut this half was through an episode, i hope this is continued in the OVA's that come out soon.

    I dunno how to say but this anime is not that so good, 
because I hate the MC because of his stupidity actions but only often. 
 
The way how the girls deceived him is the reason why I hate the MC. 
 
I know that I'm not in the place so say but, 
I just want to express my anger between the stupid MC. 
 
 
And also, firstly the story is how do I put it ; is confusing in the first but in the midst I love it and it's great . 
 
Secondly , art is good but only rather nor it is great . 
 
Thirdly, the sound/s is also good nor very good . 
 
  
Fourthly, the character/s is great also but the MC is the also one that whom I hate but not so much. 
 
Fifthly or Lastly , enjoyment ?  
Yes, I had fun but only the midst and conclusions and I rated it as good.

    With my own love for romance shows, I expected to really enjoy Amagami SS, an anime that is seemingly always recommended in romance circles. 
 
Unfortunately, this first season didn't pull me in as much as I wanted. The first arc was so terrible that it almost made me drop the show; the main character was a weeb's dream, worshiping his crush and overall being very weird, doing things that not only would put off any girl in real life, but might have the police called. 
 
Thankfully, the show and characters, including the main male, do get better, but not all of them are created equal. The unique 4-episode structure of each arc is both a positive and negative; it allows for fans to pick their favorite girl and, if one girl isn't great, they don't have to suffer for too long. However, only 4 episodes was not enough time to develop a few of these relationships. 
 
Romance shows, above all else, are supposed to bring emotion out of the viewer and this first season did not do that for me in any significant way.

    It is clearly a dating sim that was adapted to an anime. They had to cut it in many parts to have all the endings presente on the anime. So the protagonist keeps going back in the past and reliving his school days so that the espectators can see a different ending. All girls have four episodes. I only watched the first girl. The result is that everything feels a little rushed. 
 
The art is good. There isn't much complexity, but it goes well with the story. The girls all look very diferente and also very cute. 
 
The music is also nice, but the english is kind of weird.  
 
The protagonista is well constructed. He is a simple teenager searching for love. His sister is very annoying. The first girl is somewhat mysterious. At first she looks like she is faking it, but in the end she is just very extroverted. Because the anime leaves just four episodes to each girl, only the protagonista is truly developped. 
 
I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had played the game first. 
 
If you are searching for a romance/school life anime, there are many others out there that can entretain you more. I can only recomend this for those that have played and enjoyed the game.

    First impression & Bias: 
I have always been a fan of school romances, especially when they don't cater to the idea that relationships should not develop. Yes, I am a fan of dating sim adaptions to an extent. I will tell you from the start I actually didn't know this is was in omnibus format, and if you looked at my reaction in episode four you would clearly see that. Being one of the first shows I have watched to do this I didn't mind the method oh so much. Yet, this is for sure 6 different stories, and you don't need to watch any of the others to understand what is going on...which means that there is little connection between them. 
Expectation: 8 
Episode scores: -(x16),8,6,4,3,8,8,8,10,8,9 
Actual: 8 (Very Good) 
 
Analysis: 
So our male lead had a bad date two years ago on Christmas that he regrets for two full years after the fact. Promising character isn't he? Well, that is about the only thing that remains constant in all the arcs, for they producers decided that they would alter his personality differently for each; one he is aggressively pursuing his love, the other he is the exact opposite. It is impossible to have an impression of him since he changes so much. 
 
Yet, what was the killer for me was the random ecchi scenes. Some were acceptable to a point, but when Tachibana starts going delusional and imaging his date as a cup of noodles, I was laughing in a bad way. I am mean do that many people have a fetish for licking people behind their knee? I am not a very judgmental person, but if I had to judge for this review I would say..meh. Our average male lead is average, nothing out of the ordinary I guess. 
 
The heroines however aren't of course the player's character in this adaptions. They are all unique from each other, and while you may pick favorites I don't think their stories will particularly bore you. They will reoccur at spots to remind you how awesome they are too, or just to be annoying and fill in show time. For the most part you can expect good ends for all your arcs, but there is one 'bad' end in there that will sort of annoy you; of course you have to stay on yours toes and find out yourself because this review is spoiler free!   
 
That concept of inconsistency holds true throughout the arcs, for they are in essence trying to appeal to different audiences. While I am not saying that somebody who likes one arc a lot will hate the other there is always that possibility of course. Personally every other arc felt as if it drained my enjoyment from the next as I subconsciously compared them. I mean, after I finish watching a girl who is sly and intelligent, what am I suppose to think about the clumsy and slow childhood friend? 
 
Conclusion: 
While not up to the expectations to the other simulator adaptions I have loved, I consistently enjoyed tuning in every week for Amagami. Despite being a choppy omnibus format, this allows for the awesome arcs to shine and the average ones to fade out of my memory. I give this a very good out of 10.

    Amagami SS was an initially intriguing series for the reason that it tries to set itself apart from its peers in the popular ""harem romantic comedy"" genre by taking out the ""harem"" aspect and applying it in a way not typically seen in anime.  With a touch of realism added in, Amagami does do a fairly good job in its endeavor, however this isn't to say the show isn't without its flaws. 
 
In harem anime the main focus of the story often times ends up revolving around the question of ""Who exactly is the protagonist going to end up with?""  Amagami SS does completely away with this question by simply answering ""All of them!""  In doing so, Amagami removes all of the love polygons, misunderstandings, and unrequited feelings common in harem anime and instead presents the viewer with six different stories of a boy and a girl meeting, getting to know each other, and then further developing their relationship into perhaps something more.  And in the long run, these shorter stories are much more realistic than their 24 episode counterparts.  It's far more believable that, as opposed to our dopey male protagonist having five or six girls fawning for him at once for ridiculous reasons, he instead has to actually put some time and effort into getting to know each girl and developing a relationship with them before romance can occur.  Additionally, each storyline differs a pretty fair amount from the other ones so that each feels fresh and the viewer isn't left watching recycled material. 
 
There is one problem with this format however.  With six girls and only 25 episodes to develop relationships in, each arc consists of only four episodes.  Unfortunately four episodes turns out to be not enough time to really flesh out the characters or make the plots exceptionally deep.  And with a portion of each episode set aside for superficial cameos by the other main, arc-irrelevant girls, even less time is available.  There are nice romantic developments and the comedy for the series was actually a pretty good feature, but there isn't ever much drama or deep emotional issues or problems.  Even by cutting one character's arc (viewer insert least favorite girl here) and giving the other girls one more episode, a lot more meat could have been added to the stories.  Of course this show is something of an advertisement for the visual novel so removing one of the heroines was probably a no-no to begin with. 
 
Now I've never played a visual novel before, but the animation in Amagami certainly did a good job at times of really giving off that first-person visual novel feel to it.  The overall animation was pretty good as well.  Granted there weren't exactly many difficult scenes to draw, but the animators did do a great job of making the day to day scenes look bright and visually appealing.  My favorite part of the animation however, was the character designs.  Amagami as a whole was refreshing for me because it was presented as a more realism-based series and the designs fit the theme well.  We don't have girls with doe eyes or hair the color of all of the crayons in the box here, but typical browns and blacks.  Their hair styles are different to help aid with identification but for the most part the viewer is actually required to get to know the girls' personalities for identification as opposed to just hair colors. 
 
As for the girls themselves, they were just as diverse as their stories and hair styles.  We see variance in age and demeanor and thus variance in each girl's interaction with our male lead Junichi who, aside from perhaps being slightly more perverted than other leads and having no interests of his own which allows him all the time in world to help and interact with each girl, is nothing special.  It really is interesting to see the differing interactions between each girl and Junichi and watch each girl's character development as the arc goes on.  Unfortunately, the multi-story approach does limit the amount of fleshing out of each character and it becomes more than a little frustrating to  continuously finish an arc and then begin a new one with completely reset characters. 
 
(Off the record, I won't say who my favorite girls are but my favorite pairing has got to be Hibiki and Haruka.  In the other arcs their background interactions and Odd Couple feel provided my favorite humor in the series. 
 
I was a fan for the most part of the music that was served up in Amagami.  The opening themes were both fun and relaxed while the endings were as mixed of a bag as the girls.  Some were more energetic and loud while others were slower and more refined.  They all were quite distinct and for me ranged from ""meh"" to ""really good.""  The voice acting was also good, with a pretty nice combination of veterans and newer voices. 
 
So in the end I have to say that Amagami SS is actually a pretty unique and entertaining ""harem"" romance comedy.  It's only drawback is that it focuses more on being savory than having sustenance, so while each arc will go down easily, the series as a whole won't leave a lasting effect of satisfaction on the viewer.  Despite this, it does have some nice romance, some pretty odd but above standard comedy, and is an enjoyable watch, so I thoroughly recommend it.

    Essentially this anime uses the same story line throughout the entire series.  Everything is based around Tachibana.  Each ""arc"" has a different heroine.  All of which have a different story to them.  
As the series progresses little bits from the previous ""arcs"" are used in the next one. 
The first four episodes are what really got my attention.  It was one of those ""now way?!"" situations that would never happen in real life, but I like watching stuff like that.  Soon after watching the first four episodes I realized something.  Each other heroine was most likely to get four episodes too.  (Which turned out to be true)  Then why is there 25 episodes you might ask?  Well that is something for you to find out when you watch it.   
 
Nothing special about the artwork, but nothing bad either.   
 
The fact that each heroine sang their own ending them was quite awesome.  Each song really emphasized that character.  The ending songs were not as lovely as either of the opening themes.   
 
Each character had a unique personality.  All of them were very diverse, which made the anime that much more interesting.  The most popular girl in school, the girl Tachibana always hangs out with, a really shy girl, an athletic girl, childhood friend, the class president, and the secret 7th girl. 
 
I really enjoy a good love story.  Some of them really got to me.  Tear jerking, happily ever after good.  I guess the reason why I like to watch love story types of anime is because I wish reality could be like this sometimes, but reality is cruel, harsh and unforgiving place.   
If you want to get lost in a fantasy love story just like I did, then I would strongly recommend watching this.

    ---------- 
Disclaimer 
---------- 
The following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself! 
 
--------- 
Positives 
--------- 
- Everyone on the Omni-bus! 
Amagami SS's largest strength comes from its origin: An adaptation of a dating sim. That sentence alone may be groan-worthy, but it introduces some very key benefits that I will continue to list below. To summarize: There are 6 main love interest leads, which the show explores in a ""parallel universe"" arc style. Each character is dedicated a 4 episode arc, all starting around the same time with the main difference being that the main character, Junichi, ends up spending time, and blossoming love for/with, a new partner at the school. One of the greatest advantages to this format is its versatility. Don't like a particular arc? Why not try one of the other 5? You're almost guaranteed to find a pairing you'll enjoy. 
 
- Satisfyingly Short 
Giving 4 episodes to each of the characters' romance seems like it could be a rushed endeavor, but when you consider the usual pace of romances in anime, it actually feels very satisfying! Things have to move at a healthy pace in the show in order for each arc to reach its climax (the confession/kiss), so it forces much of the awkward ""do they really like me"" tropes away out of necessity. These themes are still present, as they are trying to depict young love and its pitfalls, but in a more appropriate serving than your traditional slow-burn anime romance. Additionally, the show isn't afraid to actually get to a conclusion. These are the stories of relationships forming, and as such they actually form! (Mostly)... 
 
- Building in the Background 
It's fairly obvious that the most character development for the love interests come during their arc, but Amagami SS does a tremendous job of not throwing away characters just because they're not in the spotlight. There are many scenes of non-featured love interests that help round out their overall character, as well as their interactions with the other characters in the universe. What happens to the girls when they're not getting with Junichi? How do their lives go? This extra effort also helps each character in unique ways depending on which order their arc takes place! For example, Haruka is the first arc, and as such she's the girl you know the least about. While she still has a very good arc, its her extra appearances in the background in later arcs that really solidify her character and enrich the story started at the beginning of the show. Additionally, Tsukasa's arc is done last, and benefits from the longest amount of time establishing her character. 
 
- Firm, but Flexible MC 
Junichi is our main protagonist, and as he is based off the player character in the game this show is adapting, his character has to be flexible to match all of the girls in each of their arcs. There is a huge pitfall here; Attempting to change the MC drastically risks feeling completely disjointed from a sense of singular character. Amagami SS sidesteps this with surprising ease, establishing an original character with concrete traits seen across all of the romantic arcs. His attitude differences in each of the arcs are gradual and realistic; It is not that he is changing, but rather different parts of himself are emphasized (and de-emphasized) based on his surroundings (read: love interests). I was quite impressed that I was able to completely believe him as a character in each of the arcs, despite a wide variety of difference in the women he's influenced by. 
 
- Unique EDs 
I can take or leave the OPs of this show, but the EDs are really something special. They uniquely swap with each of the characters, are sung by the voice actors, and provide a wonderful complement to the character arc as a whole. Very catchy, and diverse! 
 
--------- 
Negatives 
--------- 
- BAKA HENTAAAI 
For a show that I believe to handle relationships in a way very uniquely compared to other shows, Amagami SS stumbles often when it comes to display healthy sexuality. Junichi falls hopelessly into the ""pervert"" male trope, something that is only bad when you juxtapose the rest of the show, which handles anything remotely sexual like a hot coal. There are a few breakthrough moments where characters actually display sexual attraction or affection in a legitimate, healthy way, but for the most part there is a disappointingly strong, Japanese influence infecting most relationships in the show. I am continuously baffled by the fact shows are perfectly happy with men fantasizing about porn and the women around them with zoom shots galore, yet insist on every character fleeing from their sexuality at the first blush. Remember kids, it's healthy to push down your feelings and pretend they don't exist, so long as that repression comes out in productive ways, such as peeping, perving, and.... oh wait. Perhaps this is why I enjoyed Ai's arc the most. 
 
- MC fatigue 
While I said previously I enjoyed much of the way Junichi was handled as a main character, sadly it was simply the handling of his traits across the arcs I enjoyed. Junichi's overarching traits are sigh-inducing. As mentioned above, Junichi sits firmly entrenched in the ""pervert"" male trope, while simultaneously fleeing from real sexuality in tandem with his partners. He is also incredibly dense, going as far as asking if a love interest maybe liked him the morning AFTER she kisses him romantically. C'mon Junichi, for god's sake. He's not all bad, and he certainly has his cool or important moments, but as usual you're often left wondering exactly what the hell these great girls see in him outside of a few choice nice moments. All of these problems are solved, by the way, simply by learning to write and produce shows with healthy levels of affection and sexuality. So this is more of a further manifestation of the above negative. 
 
- Everyone OFF the Omni-bus! 
This is not a complaint, but rather a warning. While I believe the multiple short arc strategy of the show to be refreshing and positive towards the show's goals, I can understand how others may feel a bit weird about it. Perhaps you want more long-form individual relationship development, or you just get a bit of waifu-whiplash. This comes down to personal preference, so it shouldn't interfere with you trying the show; it just might be a preference you learn about once watching it. 
 
---------- 
Conclusion 
---------- 
I love Amagami SS, I really do. It does so many things amazingly well, with a refreshingly upbeat formatting and a surprisingly like-able cast overall. It handles young love and its many intricacies gently, but firmly, with solid conclusions and satisfyingly well-paced progression. I was expecting walking in to enjoy a few arcs at most, but I ended up enjoying every single one for multiple reasons. Additionally, I had a very hard time choosing which ones I liked the most, because they were all uniquely satisfying in their own rights.  
 
Where Amagami comes short for me is its last dangling threads connecting to unsatisfying romance tropes. It clings desperately to an cultural view of sexuality that is tired and taken to unhealthy levels. I do not propose that there needs to be outright sex within the show, but more consistent displays of genuine, two-sided affection would push this show over the top. 
 
Overall, do not let my negatives deter you. They are incredibly minor compared to the absolutely wonderful rest of the show, which is a delight to watch and a wonderful set of short romance stories. Let go of your worries, and dive headfirst into one of my favourite animes ever! 
 
By the way: Ai > Kaoru = Tsukasa = Haruka > Sae > Rihoko 
(These rankings only relevant for Season 1; See my Season 2 review for updated rankings!) 
 
------------ 
Final Rating 
------------ 
While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: ""Would you recommend I watch this show?"". Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show's genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So, 
 
If you are a fan of Romance, Amagami SS's formula offers something a bit different, which makes it stand out enough to be very enjoyable. Even if the formula isn't new to you, there's a lot in the show to enjoy, so give it a shot! You won't regret it. 
 
If you are new to/interested in the above genre(s), then this is an absolute must. The wide variety of stories, with relatively quick pacing, is perfect for hooking you on the genre.

    The cool thing about Amagami SS is its premise. Each part of a heroine tells of a boy's relationship with a different girl, a kind of universe for each type of relationship between the protagonist and a heroine. This is cool because this anime does not deal with treason much less than harem. This is a girl with a certain personality to make a pair with him. It's an anime with a light plot, good moments of laughter and endings striking each heroine, and may be better than others. 
 
Amagami SS is the typical anime to the taste of the customer. Those who watch will be able to select their best story and their best plot for themselves, without needing to get into controversial issues of who is the best.

    ~Note~ 
-Possible Spoilers 
- I have the second season in mind. 
 
If you are a harem fan you would probably at least once ask the question, ""What if the main character chose the other girl."" Amagami SS is the answer to that question. I'm a big harem fan, but was never the romance specific type; that was until I watched Amagami SS. 
 
-Story: You are introduced to the story with Tachibana Junichi. He was stood up by a girl on Christmas Eve 2 years ago, and now he has given up on love. The story follows with that mindset at the start of each story arc.  Each arc includes Junichi, our main protagonist, and one of the six girls as the main heroine. There are six main arcs that are four episodes long, and two other arcs for Miya, Junichi's sister,  and Risa which are one or two episode only. As far as story goes, these six girls are either girls he already knows or never met before. What I really love about this anime is, each girl has a happy ending. It doesn't matter if you like one girl more then the other, because they all have happy endings regardless. 
 
- Art: The animation is good. I seen a lot of anime that aired in 2010-2012 and this is got to be one of the best. One thing that stood out, which was really original, was how they changed the opening and ending animation to which girl is the main heroine for that arc. I really like how in the second season, they would put the main heroine in the last to show us that was for their arc. Even some little animation changes really made this anime better. 
 
- Sound: The sound for this anime was outstanding as well. There was a lot of likeable songs. In the first season, at the end of every episode; had different ending songs for each main heroine. The opening songs for both seasons were all really upbeat but it's amazing how they also set the mood for a romance anime.  
 
- Character: The characters are this anime are just the best. I have no way to describe them with words but the best or perfect. The character development for this anime was one of the best I ever seen in an anime. 
To think they did so much with only four episodes each girl is well deserved of praise. Sure, in each arc only one girl gets basically 100% attention, but they have their own respected arcs so you can't complain. All the girls have their only unique personalities which is one thing I really like about this anime. They make it so you at least like one girl. But I liked all the girls, they were all unique, had their own problems to deal with. The only thing I could even say I didn't like as much, is the main character Junichi. There were some moments where he just seemed so oblivious of things, that it was annoying. But I won't hold it against the anime because it made things more interesting to watch. 
 
-Enjoyment: Let me just say if you don't enjoy this anime, you probably won't like any other romance anime out there. You are given six arcs with different girls with different personalities. Because of their different personalities we have to watch Junichi approach them differently. This anime has also a lot of comedic moments. Lots are revolted around Junichi, because his the typical perverted guy. So I hope you can imagine some things he does. Each arc has a different senses of comedy because it revolts around the girl's personalities but there are definitely comedy in this anime for sure. 
 
-Overall: No matter what mindset you watch this with, I guarantee you will like this anime. I was a person who did not pick up on the romance genre but after watching Amagami SS I will start too. Whether you watch this with a open mind or expectations, you will be begging for more. 
 
-Pros: 
- Six different girls. 
- All have Happy Endings. 
-Anime very is original in every way. 
-Likeable characters. 
-Very well developed characters. 
 
-Cons: 
-I beg for another season.

    This is an odd show to review, since the story sounds so run of the mill and bland that I would usually write it off if not for the interesting premise. Basically, it would do a continuity reset every four episodes, which were aptly named after the girl they were based around. After one of these resets, the story arc would then shift to the new girl and we'd watch as our main character interacts with her and witness as they begin to fall in love with one another. Rinse and repeat. 
 
Thankfully, each of the girls is different from one another in their own distinct way, so it's never bland, even if the story keeps reusing the same Christmas festival as the ending point, which got pretty old by the third reset. For most of the arcs, the characters themselves were usually able to keep it afloat, even when it was reaching a slump.  
 
Each arc opens with an explanation about our hero: Junichi, and how he has been brooding for the past two years, ever since he was stood up on a date that he planned with a girl he liked in middle school. Since then, he has been reluctant to love anyone, and instead, digs into porno magazines with his best friend, Umehara. 
 
I'll review each arc individually, since you could pretty much watch them in any order you so please. 
 
Arc 1 - Haruka Morishima: 
This was easily my favorite arc of the bunch, which is unfortunate because it was also the first one of the bunch. Haruka is a fun character to watch, since she's both eccentric, and very damn weird. She's playful, and has a soft side for the adorable (Most notably puppies). Oddly enough, despite her oddity, she's the most popular girl in the school (And in my opinion, she easily has the best drawn eyes of the entire cast). Our protagonist has heard the constant rumors of her, and by mere chance he meets her during lunch one day. Like any other boy in the school, he's immediately smitten by her, and he decides to try and pursue her romantically from there on. 
 
Saying much more would be going too deeply into spoiler territory, but suffice to say, the two of them complement each other well, and the conclusion to the arc is very fulfilling. I'd give it a 10/10 relative to the rest of the show. 
 
Arc 2 - Kaoru Tanamachi: 
Kaoru has been Junichi's friend for three years now, ever since she invited him to her house on the fateful day when he was stood up. Due to that, his personality in this arc is different than the previous. Where in the first arc he was a brooding kid, this time he doesn't waste any time brooding thanks to his dear friend. Unfortunately, this arc is just ok for me. I don't particularly care for it, and the writing isn't well done, since I got confused about what exactly some of the later conflicts of the arc were about. Kaoru herself though is a pretty cool character, pretty much a female version of a bro for Junichi, doing whatever she can to make him feel better whenever. 
 
The arc isn't necessarily bad, but the conflict felt forced, and honestly kind of stupid. Perhaps it was because they didn't have enough time in the four episode frame they put themselves into, and couldn't go deeper into her reasons. However, despite that, this one also had a fairly good ending. Relative to the rest of the show, I'd give this arc a 6/10. 
 
Arc 3 - Sae Nakata: 
Sae is a textbook definition of Moe. She is painfully shy, she has big breasts (Which is constantly lampshaded), she's only a first year, she calls Junichi 'sempai' all the time, and she can't speak above a whisper. What isn't there to love about this character? This arc takes a more refreshing direction than the last ones, focusing much more heavily on comedy, and breaking the fourth wall more than once to do so. It's also the only arc of the bunch to feature a narrator, oddly enough. The two of them definitely make a cute couple, and their sensei- student relationship is a LOT of fun to watch, and it all adds up to a fun ending, that might possibly kill you on pure Moe alone. This arc gets a 7/10 from me. 
 
Arc 4 - Ai Nanasaki 
This arc returns back to basics set by the first two arcs, however, it focuses on another first year student this time around - Ai. Unlike Sae, they cut out all the Moe, and instead make her out to be a calm, determined, hardheaded, and dry-humored girl. I actually really liked Ai, she was the first girl to be 'normal' relative to the rest of the cast, and while that sounds like it's a bad thing, it actually works very well. The only problem I have with this arc is that it felt as if the romance occurred too quickly, and Ai warms up to Junichi way too quickly. Again, this is probably an issue involving only having 4 episodes to show it in, but other than that minor complaint, I really liked this one. Ai is also freaking adorable, so bonus points for that. 8/10 is what I rate it. 
 
Arc 5 - Rihoko Sakurai 
Rihoko is Junichi's childhood friend, whom she has known since she was in elementary school, with that premise alone, you'd just expect it to be like any other romance anime. Unfortunately I did not care for this arc at all. Out of all six arcs, this is the only one I would actually recommend skipping. It goes absolutely nowhere in the four episodes given, and I read online that it's because the people who made it absolutely butchered her storyline. I'd just recommend reading up her best ending from the game online, because that is MUCH more satisfying than watching this. I will give this arc some credit though, since it focuses on the girl instead of Junichi this time around, and it also has a heavier emphasis on the side characters than any of the previous arcs did. Despite that though, the ending, if you hadn't have guessed, absolutely sucked. It's so poorly done that I can't think of a single memorable moment from it other than how it ended, and I just finished this show a day ago. This arc gets a 3/10 from me. 
 
Arc 6 - Tsukasa Ayatsuji 
Right when the show starts to get stale, we get into this arc, which seems to just be another 'boy meets a nice girl and falls in love' routine. However, unlike any of the other arcs, this one has a twist I absolutely love (It's actually foreshadowed in Rihoko's arc a little bit, but I still recommend staying away from Rihoko's arc). Tsukasa is a very interesting character, and seeing her different layers of her personality is a whole lot of fun to watch. In this arc, surprisingly the romance starts early, and then takes a backseat for a little while as it focuses more on Tsukasa and her problems setting up the festival and other issues she has to deal with. Out of every arc, this one deserved the most at least another two episodes to fully flesh out, because by the end there were a few unanswered questions that I was left asking. Oddly enough, this arc is also the one that fleshes out Umehara the most, and you can see here why he and Junichi are such bros with one another. 
 
It ultimately came down to preference with me - while I highly enjoyed this arc, I just preferred Haruka from arc 1 more than I did Tsukasa. However, even saying that, if I had to choose which ending to be canon for this show, I would go with Tsukasa. A quick note: If you do intend to watch this show, while you can watch every arc in any order, this is the only one in which I would highly recommend saving for last, you'll know exactly why I mean that when you do watch the arc. This was easily the second best arc in the show, earning from me a 10/10. 
 
With the plots and characters out of the way, there are just a few more things I feel like mentioning: 
 
The art: I LOVED the art style in this show. It goes with more realistic proportions, but it still has the undeniable anime charm, furthermore, I LOVED Haruka's eyes - too bad so few other characters were drawn with those kind of eyes. However, there were a handful of weird shots from oddly placed camera angles that made the characters proportions look off model, and a few more times when their heads looked awfully weird. More often than not though, the art was consistently good. Also worth noting, is that despite the more realistic art style, every character looks different from one another. Each of the six main girls look way different from one another, and every side character also looked much different. It's pretty impressive that a cast of about 15~ or so characters don't look even slightly the same (Except for Miya - Junichi's sister - and Ai, I had a hard time distinguishing them apart for a little while).  
 
The animation: Well, it's not an action show, so animation isn't quite that important, but for the most part, it was nicely done. They don't go out of their way with the animation like Kyoto-animation does in their own shows (ex: Eyes don't move when they are reading books, they repeat a few basic movements while they are talking), but it never looked choppy at all. Also, I noticed that in almost every arcs ending the animation quality went up. This is most noticeable in Ai's ending (Look at her lip movement when she talks, it's really smooth and a pleasure to watch).  
 
The Music: Mostly forgettable. The only two pieces of music in the show I liked were the openings, the rest didn't leave much of an impression on me at all. Each girl also gets to sing their own ending song, but like I said, none of them stuck with me and for the life of me I couldn't hum a single one even though I have watched all of them at least half a dozen times. Basically, the tracks are good for what they set out to accomplish, but it's not anything I will be going out of my way to download (Unlike the Clannad soundtrack).  
 
Opening/closing credits evolution: Heh, this one probably doesn't need its own category, but I would just like to point out that in each arc the opening is slightly different depending on the girl the arc is based on. I love things like that, and while it's nowhere near noticeable like how it was in say, Angel Beats, it's still a very nice touch. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier the credits change depending on which girl the arc is about. It's kind of funny to listen to some of these, because in one case, I remember thinking that it didn't sound like the girl at all. 
 
Overall, it's a fun show to watch. I recommend it to people wanting a short and sweet romance, but don't expect anything very deep. With a good cast of characters, good art and animation, and a strong enough story to carry them all, this show averages out to an 8/10 from me.

    Amagami...or Gentle bite in english..the story revolve with Junichi as the protagonist and the girls as his route for romance.. 
 
From it's title you will see a story that first a start with a break-up and for the good that he find his true love...I can say that was really shallow story though when you get into the depp part it was great, heartwarming, and enjoyable.  
 
=Story Line= 
 
for the story, it was a lame and unbelievable routes, though overall was hilarious, a bit rushed, and how can say, great romance..never thought that for four episodes a whole story can be told...very unique 
 
=Art= 
 
wew...the art was awesome, graphically i mean. 
 
=Sound= 
 
A bit off, but not that far and romance scenes must have a heightened music..many insert music are timely done though not most.. 
 
=Characters= 
 
Three word----Two Thumbs Up---couldn't say anything else...really great!! 
 
And Overall, very romantic, i'm a fan of a romance anime but i'm a little disappointed that i'm looking for more..thank god for the second season..A rating of 9 is very very good (i'm hoping for better for the next season and maybe longer series...so it's a 9)!! 
 
Peace Y'all ^^

    When recommending Amagami SS I often say that single route from it is better than most full 12/24 eps romance anime. And I'm serious when I say it. 
 
Story 
At first glance nothing special. School setting, no superpowers, rivals or saving the world. It's pure high school romance. The only thing that gives this setting some individuality is, as mentioned in synopsis, protagonist's backstory of being stood up on Christmas date two years ago. Sadly, this part isn't fleshed enough and is used mostly for flashbacks that don't have as much impact on the story as they should. 
What really changes Amagami story from average school romance into something great is so called ""omnibus format"". Each heroine gets 4 episodes (and 2 more in sequel) then story resets and follows different ""route"" that leads to protagonist ending with different girl. I know some people hate it, but in my opinion omnibus format is what saved Amagami SS from being another harem into one of the best (again imho) romance anime out there. 
One might ask if having so few episodes for each girl won't make it too rushed. It's true some parts of story could go slightly slower, on the other hand repeating same time period multiple times and showing some events from multiple perspectives makes up for it. 
 
Art/Sound 
When it comes to art, character design is where Amagami SS shines. All main heroines are drawn really well and with good attention to detail. Backgrounds are also solid. Animation on the other hand could be better - it's not bad, but also nothing special. 
There is not much to say about sound. Opening and ending are awesome and really fitting, but other than that music in this anime isn't something worth mentioning. 
 
Characters 
Obviously the most important part. 
Let's start with Junichi, our beloved protagonist. Unlike usual male protagonists in anime focused on romance with multiple girls (mostly harems), Junichi has personality. He isn't another introverted nobody - he can be pretty eccentric and crazy, is confident but at the same time is ""normal"". It's also interesting how different sides of his character are shown in different routes - subtle but noticeable. 
Heroines in Amagami SS are also interesting characters. Each of them is very different, with common trait of being more than you could guess at first glance. Obviously there's also similar problem to one I mentioned in story section: is 4 episodes per girl enough for proper character development? Yes, it is. While watching single route could leave one dissatisfied, watching all of them, just as with the story, allows viewer to see characters in multiple situations that expand on what we learned about them during their respective arcs. This way of getting to know characters is surprisingly effective and fun. 
As for notable side characters, there is the best of all imouto characters - Miya - cute, fun and actual sister, without any incest vibes (for better or worse). Umehara - solid ""best friend"" character. And there is also hidden heroine that answers some questions about the story, but sadly doesn't get as much attention as she (imho) deserves. 
 
Enjoyment 
It's simple. If omnibus format doesn't bother you, you should love it. If it does, you will hate it. Watching multiple short romances in the same setting is unexpectedly enjoyable. Routes are short enough to keep viewers attention for their whole duration and having all girls present somewhere in every route connects them enough to make it enjoyable as a complete anime, not just separate stories.

    Okay, let me get this out of the way first: Rahxephon is one of my favorite anime, ever. 
I can't say I've ever been much into the mecha genre of anime. I saw Gundam Wing in the early days of Toonami when I was a wee little weaboo, and held little interest for giant robots and political entanglements between fictional countries that I couldn't keep track of. 
I remember when Rahxephon was still airing in Japan, and there was a big fuss being made about it over there. In fact, it had caused enough buzz that it was quickly licensed and was already being dubbed by ADV in less than a month after its last episode aired. Not only that, but the art style was interesting, especially the color choices. 
The first time I picked it up and watched the first volume, I hit the series' first snag - it can be pretty difficult to get into. It was too abstract, too confusing; I had no idea what the hell was going on. I dropped it for a year or so. I'm glad, however, that I picked it up again a few years ago just to see how it ended. 
Yes, Rahxephon is very difficult to get into. It's very abstract and doesn't follow too many of the usual anime norms; not to mention all the negative press that it gets for being an Eva rip-off. I feel I need to remind the reader that Evangelion was written as a PARODY of the mecha genre. Yes, there are similarities between the two; but those similarities are exactly what Evangelion was making fun of. Please keep that in mind. 
Despite this initial pitfall of being difficult to understand, I have to stress that the series becomes a lot more clear if you stick it out through the end. Unfortunately, unless you pay very close attention to every character and everything that goes on in every episode, the actual plot might still be muddy to you. The whole story is never clearly and succintly explained; I kind of like that, even if I have trouble sorting out the &quot;bad guy&quot;'s motivation and intentions. 
I'm a sucker in general for main characters, but I love Ayato. He's not always strong, he doesn't always know what he's doing, he's a bit naive. But he's a good kid and always comes through in the end, and he's very realistic and flawed. Haruka is also a heavily flawed but still likeable character, and you really see why she is how she is by the end of the show. 
As for the music and animation, the art style is striking and has a really impressive color palette. Rahxephon's distinctive art direction still sticks in my mind to this day and is a big inspiration in my artwork. The music is also very unusual and never overbearing.  
So, bottom line: give it a try, and watch through the end. (Read my review of the Rahxephon movie for additional info) The show is very unusual, but ultimately beautiful. It's heavily abstract and symbolic, so you need to have the right openness of mind to be able to see the show for what it is, but if you do, it's amazing what you'll find in it.

    if you haven't watched this anime yet, and haven't because of some people saying it is a Neon Genesis Evangelion knock off, i just have to say...yeah, it is, but that doesn't change that it is a great anime, to tell you the truth, i would call this the simpler man's NGE, and it's totally understandable if they enjoy this more than NGE, the story is kind of complicated, but it doesn't leave too many questions left unanswered, and isn't too predictable, the music of the anime fits the mood well, and the ED is a deep, chilling song, the character designs are beautiful, and the animation is always at a high level, character development progresses well, except for the occasional change in feelings or personality that happened too quickly, enjoyment wise, i really liked it, so much that i marathoned the series after the 2nd or 3rd episode

    Ah... RahXephon...  
 
Where do I even begin? 
 
First off, if you're walking into this with expectations, you'll be disappointed. If you have almost no  expectations at all (Like I did), you'll still be disappointed. 
 
 
Story: 
I find it funny how people can praise this as being, “Well written,” or say it has a, “Complex story,” seriously... 
If you thought either of those things after watching this the whole way through, then you need to see a doctor. Yes, I know there's different ways of telling a story, but then there's just throwing a bunch of random bull!@#$ at the viewers with no context or meaning. Yet, people seem to have a big enough of an imagination that they force themselves (And others) to believe that, if it doesn't make sense you just have to, “Think harder,” because every little thing is symbolic somehow right? People LOVE using symbolism to convince people that the piece of crap they're trying to sell you is actually a diamond. “Well, if you look at it this way.” they say... 
Don't listen to them, or that little voice in your head saying that you might have, “Missed something,” or that maybe, “It's just to complicated for you.” Because it's not. Some other shows? Maybe... but this one? No, just no. 
You'd have to be delusional to say this is a, “Great anime.” After watching RahXephon, just reading through the reviews here will make you lose your faith in humanity (If you have any left). I can't help but think that everyone's being raised as idiots, or maybe it's genetic. 
 
 
“Characters:” 
Other people say that the story was fair, but the characters were, “Second to sound,” don't make me laugh. So, as for the characters... 
Can they really even be called that?  
When they come and go with almost non-existent back story and personalities?  
(I mean, COME ON... just because they say to themselves, “I like person X, but they don't like me back. Life is hard :'(  “ doesn't mean they actually have personalities, ok?) 
Or when they die and then reappear again with absolutely no explanation like nothing ever happened?  
Or how about when the main one is having an identity crisis every other episode, even after he's already come to the conclusion that he knows who he is TWICE already! And that's on top of the fact that he keeps forgetting who he likes every time there's a girl who throws herself at him.  
 
 
This isn't even supposed to be a romance drama is it? Because if it is, it failed horribly at that too. It seems to me that the writer (If they should even be called one) were just making this up as they went along. Their thought process going something like:  
	“We need don't have enough story for 26 episodes, lets come up with something so we can keep airing... I GOT IT! Lets throw a girl at the MC in this episode, add a random mecha to fight here, make this girl disappear so we can throw another one, another random mecha to fight there... Oh wait! We don't have that many episodes left after all that, “Story,” time to make the MC remember who he really likes before it ends!” 
... 
 
You get the idea. (I hope) 
I could go on and on explaining how bad it turned out to be by the end of it, but if you didn't get my point by now, then there's really nothing else I can do to persuade you out of wasting your time, so that's all I have to say about it. (It's 1 am crazy rant over) 
 
Well, now that I'm finished writing this review, I'm going to try and erase this show from my memory. Maybe Ayato can hook me up with something, he's gotta be on some sort of drug to be forgetting everything as much as he is. (Plus, if hallucinations are a side effect, that would certainly explain a lot.) 
 
Keep it real, peace.

    RahXephon originally aired on TV in 2002 and was one of the earliest anime produced by BONES, a studio that was formed when certain staff members from Sunrise, the industry’s foremost producers of mecha anime, broke off to form their own studio. It was the directorial debut of Yutaka Izubuchi, a veteran mecha and character designer who got his start back in the 1970s. 
 
RahXephon’s plot starts in rather complicated fashion. We are introduced to Ayato Kamina, a 17 year old high school student who is an aspiring artist. Ayato and the general populace believe Tokyo to be the only city remaining on the Earth after a mysterious force known as the Mu invaded in 2012. When an enemy force attacks Tokyo, Ayato’s world is suddenly thrown upside down. After departing a crashed subway car, Ayato is pursued by government agents and rescued by a mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow, who requests he come with her. Ayato instead escapes from her as well and encountering fellow student Reika Mishima they soon finds themselves in an underground station before a giant egg. The egg hatches, exposing the titular mecha, RahXephon. 
 
In short order things get even stranger for Ayato. He finds himself able to pilot the RahXephon and defeats a giant clay mecha known as a Dolem after it seemingly kills Mishima. The RahXephon transports outside of Tokyo, which is surrounded by a barrier called Tokyo Jupiter. Haruka, who had accompanied Ayato outside reveals the truth to him, that the rest of the world remains, and that time passes far slower inside the barrier. Outside, 12 years have gone by. The Mu control Tokyo, and their ranks include his own mother, who is revealed to bleed blue blood before the RahXephon escapes. A lot to digest in just the first few episodes, but things shift to a more traditional narrative as Ayato joins up with the anti-Mu organization known as TERRA and fights against Dolem attacks while getting used to his new life.  
 
RahXephon has a healthy mix of character development and mystery, while one will find that most of the mecha battles are curb stomps where the RahXephon wins pretty easily. The show often comes off as if the mecha fights were included because that’s the genre it’s in, but the producers wanted to get through them as quickly as possible. This is especially apparent early in the show before things settle into more serialized storytelling around halfway through. It may not be the best show for mecha junkies, but is incredibly satisfying from a plot perspective throughout and contains a ton of interesting, and sympathetic characters. The show can certainly be complex at times; there are mysteries that go the entire course of the series before being solved, cryptic characters and the show has a healthy mix of technobabble, or should I say Mulian babble. By the time you are through with this show you will have heard terms such as “Ollin”, “Ixtli” or “Yolteotl” more times than you can count. The show also has a really fulfilling love story, one of my personal favorites in anime, albeit one that is rather non-traditional for reasons I won’t get into to avoid spoilers. It is a quite an emotional experience; an episode around two thirds of the way through is widely acclaimed on that front by anyone who has seen the show and I find the show’s conclusion just as good. 
 
RahXephon has often been described as an Evanglion ripoff and I can’t stress enough to ignore such claims and watch the show without considering the shadow of Eva. Those who claim the show to be a ripoff are quite ignorant of their mecha anime history. While both shows are of the same genre and share some surface similarities as a result, RahXephon in fact draws its primary inspiration from the 1970s anime Brave Raideen and the Robert Young short story Dandelion Girl. Much of the show’s terms and concepts also draw upon James Churchward’s fictional continent/civilization of Mu. RahXephon I actually consider to be quite superior to Eva, it lacks the numerous production issues that plagued that show, paces itself far better, has far more likable and sympathetic characters and sticks to a proper landing with its ending. 
 
Aesthetically, RahXephon’s animation is fairly strong, with only one episode that I can think of being of noticeable less quality than the others. I am not the biggest fan of the character style, although they are generally well designed and unique in appearance. While the mecha battles tend to be rather short, the mecha designs are quite strong, with numerous examples of bizarre enemies for Ayato to fight. Musically the show is quite the masterpiece. Composer Ichiko Hashimoto does a tremendous job mixing a wide variety of genres including jazz pieces, piano, even rock songs. She also has many musical themes inspired by the Polovtsian Dances from the opera Prince Igor. Hashimoto sings the song’s ending theme, Yume no Tamago, a wonderful piece of music and one of my all-time favorite anime ending themes/sequences. She also provides the voice for Ayato’s mother, Maya, in one of the most haunting voices I’ve heard in an anime. I’ve never run across her again in any other anime I’ve seen, which is quite unfortunate. The show’s opening theme, Hemisphere is also quite strong, composed by the well-known Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto, who voices Mishima. The one downside is that despite having 3 separate CDs released for it, there are still many songs, including some of the best ones that are completely left off the soundtrack. 
 
I can’t stress enough how good this show is. It is a strong recommend for any fans of the mecha or sci-fi genre.

    I only gave a couple 9's for variety's sake there, this is one of the best. If Anno and the Evangelion crew hadn't scrambled for an ending, and if they had even a trace of sympathy for their fellow man, and if they'd used BONES to animate, they might have come out with RahXephon. 
 
It's about supernatural robots, it's about one young man shouldering the responsibility to save the world, but more importantly it's about things that Eva isn't &mdash;&nbsp;love, family, faith in each other, and it carries a message of hope rather than contempt for humanity.  
 
It does all that in an action-packed, surreal, package that's spiced up with a little romance and populated by realistic and likable characters.

     A very impressive anime; wonderful animation and brilliant plot. 
 
PLOT: On the surface you do immediately get Neon Genesis Evangelion vibes, but RahXephon quickly establishes itself as unique with fantastic character development and a highly original convoluted plot. The show is also much more balanced than EVA – carefully crafted plot progression and with a satisfying ending, it makes for wonderful viewing as each episode adds something to the rich tapestry of plot threads. The characters are extremely well developed and likable – there is a notable lack of the angst that permeates EVA as RahXephon instead focuses on romance. Indeed the main thread of the plot is a touching love story more than anything else – I found this extremely refreshing in a mecha series. Of course the show has numerous points that had me highly confused and I can not claim to understand exactly what happened at the end, but I got most of it in this 1st viewing – I’ll definitely be watching this show again at some stage though as I’m positive I’ve missed some subtle plot points. Do not watch this show unless you are willing to commit some of your brain cells to it, as the complexity of the plot requires you to be awake when watching! 
 
ANIMATION: Wonderful. Simply wonderful – it’s rare to get such consistently high quality animation in a 26-episode TV show, but BONES have delivered a stunning show. The backgrounds are detailed and vivid, the mecha designs highly original and organic, and the character designs are well thought out and pleasing to the eye. Lots and lots of symbolism is used throughout the series, a lot of it centred on the contrast between the red blood of the humans and the blue blood of the murians – the two opposing colours are the most dominant in the colour palate used. Overall a very well animated show – BONES have once again outdone themselves. 
 
MUSIC: As much of the plot revolves around music and sound, the soundscape of RahXephon is nothing short of brilliant. Highly atmospheric and rich in tone, the score is like another character and supports the plot perfectly. Lots of operatic vocal work for the D1 Aria’s elevates the action scenes to another level as a cacophony of sound assails you. The background music is well composed and has a timeless classical air to it. I also loved the OP & ED and never skipped over them. 
 
VOICE ACTING: A extremely talented group of seiyuu provide the voice work for this series, so many that’s its hard to pick out the best of them! However Hiro Shimono (Akihisa - BakaTest, Keima - KamiNomi ) as Ayato deserves praise as it would have been so easy to let Ayato become bogged down in Shinji-type angst, but he manages to hold back and keep Ayato’s character strong but sympathetic. It’s all the more remarkable, as this was Shimono’s debut role and I generally don't much like his voice! The rest of the cast is equally strong. 
 
So yeah, I really liked RahXephon and really highly recommend it to everyone – especially anyone who enjoyed Evangelion.

    I really expected this show to be decent based on the great reviews I've seen, but from the beginning until episode 13 when I finally gave up, I couldn't find anything about the show that I actually enjoyed. The plot was absolute nonsense and none of the characters were interesting in the least. The animation, soundtrack, and dialogue were all completely average. I wouldn't personally recommend this show, but that's just my  opinion. Clearly, other people have found something in this show that i haven't seen so feel free to look elsewhere for advice, but I did not enjoy this show.

    A special anime. 
 
Another anime that's arguably is one of the top ten anime ever. RahXephon is compared by many to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Most say it's better just because it came out a little over a year first. I whole heartily disagree. Evangelion was a complete waste of time. Where Evangelion had a convoluted story, annoying charcters, and bad music.  
 
Where Evangelion fails RahXephon succeeds. Rahxephon follows the story of Ayato Kamina who lives in Tokyo, the last out post of the human race. At least that's what he believes until he meets Reika Mishima. She secretly has known him since they were children. She convinces Ayato to leave Tokyo with her, and they escape aboard a giant robot called the RahXephon. When they leave Tokyo every thing changes for Ayato. He learns that there are people still alive on earth outside of Tokyo, and that the people inside Tokyo are called MU and aren't human. RahXephon blends all the elements of drama, action, romance and some comedy beautifully. There's nothing to complain about. The story is crafted perfectly and coherently so you can understand what they creators of the show are trying to say. The animation style is great, and the music is classic. I loved them adding classical music to anime. Ultimately though what made this a great anime were the characters. None of them were annoying, each growing and moving forward, showing emotion and making you believe they are alive and care about them. I first watched RahXephon back in 2003. I just recently finished watching it for the fourth time. I haven't seen to many anime that are better than RahXephon. I will keep recommending it over Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's a must see.

    Finally! A Bones animation I didn't like. 
 
A oddly well-received anime, it must translate poorly to Western viewers. 
 
STORY: One of the hardest things in anime is setting up an explanation on (1) why giant robots run around battling each other and (2) why teenagers would be allowed to pilot them.  RahXephon fails badly.  It forms an alternative alien society that has singing giant robots with an Egyptian/Mayan motif, throws in various conspiratorial entities and characters, adds a dash of military, and blends in a gaggle of harem romances.  All of this mixes together to form an unfortunate scramble that was a tad overcooked.  The protagonist is boring, most of the female romantic interests (I think that there were like 10 or so) are uninteresting, and the other supporting characters undeveloped.  The military unit acts like they are all in high school.  I won't spoil the plot but it doesn't make any sense. 
 
ART: This is Bones, so it is good.  Not as good as DTB or E7, but pretty good.  I hated the design of the mecha, but since the mecha don't really matter that much anyways it's not a biggie. 
 
SOUND: For an anime based on singing and music, the sound in this anime is pretty boring.   
 
CHARACTER: See my story section, it says it all. 
 
ENJOYMENT: I wish I would have skipped this anime so I could have spent my time watching or re-watching something else.   
 
OVERALL: 5.  The art is good, the rest lags. 
 
Final assessment: those who said that if you hated Evan, you would probably like this were wrong.  While not as terrible as Evan it's not that great.  If I hadn't enjoyed Code Geass and to a lesser extent Gurren, I would have given up on the genre.  But while I won't avoid future mecha anime I sure won't seek them out either after seeing this ""classic""!

    ""There are no original ideas. There are only original people.""- Barbara Grizzuti Harrison 
 
Originality doesn't exist nowadays. If there is an idea out there that someone is contemplating, chances are,  someone already beat them to the punch. I remember, during my freshman year of high school my teacher told me that even Shakespeare had taken ideas from even older writers for his plays. In writing, it is common that your ideas share similarities with other works. However, it is the writer’s responsibility to distinguish his/her works from others by adding their own unique style to it. The same applies to anime. RahXephon borrows a lot of elements from its predecessors: Evangelion, Brave Raideen and still manages to maintain its originality.  
 
Story(9/10)- Simply put, the story is about a young boy, Ayato Kamina, who lives a normal life in Tokyo, until one day, mysterious creatures attack. He encounters a strange but beautiful girl, and tries to find his way out of this carnage. Unbeknownst to him, Ayato has the special ability to pilot a mysterious Dolem/mecha called, ""RahXephon."" Now, this is probably a cliché found a litany of other shows, but do not be fooled, this show is anything but a cliché. Ayato soon finds himself in an alternate reality which he feels misplaced. Separated from both his family and friends, Ayato pilots the RahXephon in hopes it will give his life a purpose. RahXephon weaves in its existential themes without preaching them to you; it gives the viewer a chance to absorb it. The ending is usually the part that makes or breaks an anime like this. Let me tell you, this ending is probably one of the best endings to an anime ever. I am not just saying, I mean it 100%. After all the drama and pain, the payoff is well worth it. 
 
Sound(10/10)- Music is an integral part to Rahxephon. The show effortlessly incorporates the theme of music into every part of the show. In the title, the root word, Ephon, means the -phone in an instrument. It is the force, besides art, that drives to show to new heights. If you listen closely to the music in RahXephon, it pitches to the many thematic highs and lows of the story. I can tell you, any lover of music will truly appreciate RahXephon. 
 
Art(9/10)- The art still remains breathtaking till this day. Studio BONES is best known for the beautiful animation in Wolf's Rain, Darker than Black Etc. The show has a very soft color palette; it is very easy on the eyes. It gives off a calming atmosphere, one that will soothe you. There is a lot of symbolism in this show, not Penguindrum or Evangelion levels, but it is present.  
 
Now the part everyone has been waiting for, the Evangelion comparison. The show’s number one criticism is that it is exactly like EVA. I scoff at the notion, as the similarities between RahXephon and Evangelion are merely superficial at best. When you get the core of both shows, you recognize they are both fundamentally, and philosophically different from each other. Yes, they are both shows about teenaged boys trying to find meaning in their lives but while EVA is more cynical in its approach, RahXephon is much more optimistic. Evangelion tries to weave a more realistic story with its cynical and flawed characters while RahXephon is a much more, surrealist experience, every episode feels like you are waking up from a long, long dream.  
 
Characters(9/10)- The cast of RahXephon is very contradistinctive when compared to cast of most modern day mecha anime. They stray away from the usual archetypes: tsundere, psychopath, generic emotionally repressed villain among other common character tropes. All of the center characters are really fleshed out and very…..human. Everyone has their own faults but they battle with them, and move past them rather than wasting several episodes brooding over events in an, “O woe is me,” attitude like most angsty teenaged protagonists.  Briefly touching on the romance aspect, I must say it is very tastefully done. Every romance comes off organic and real. Instead of the over the top teary confessions you find in most romance anime, RahXephon relies on subtlety and nuance to present romance. From two characters simply holding eye contact with each other, or them flirtatiously wrestling around, you know the characters like each other without them saying it outright. So many heartwarming moments like this lace the show and makes it much sadder when the journey ends.  
 
RahXephon is a show that can stand tall on its own merits. It borrows from several sources but keeps the anime from turning into a pastiche by melding all these ideas into a cohesive, poignant and emotionally evocative experience.  By seamlessly blending mysticism, philosophy and romance, RahXephon is able to stand apart from its counterparts. It has a soul of its very own, and that is what makes it shine so incandescently.

    You know, it's actually kind of hard to write a positive review. It's not that it's hard to point out positive aspects of something. But it's a bit harder to justify your praise for it, without coming off as a fanatic that choses to ignore it's flaws. By contrast, it's far easier to justify a negative review. My last review of School Days was one of the easiest things i've ever written. A show that i detested for so many reasons, and that others felt the same about, so it was easy to justify my negativity. But what about a review of my favorite show? One that i believe to be a masterpiece, yet many do not, either out of ignorance of the shows existence, or out of spite for it's similarities to the elephant in the room of anime. It's been a review that i've been a bit fearful of writing, but i simply cannot hold back any longer. This, ladies and gentlemen, is my review of my number one favorite anime, RahXephon. 
 
Story (9/10) 
 
          In the year 2012, a human-like species called the Mu invade Japan. But that is not where our story begins. Our story begins in the year 2015 in Tokyo, where a young artist named Ayato Kamina is attacked by government officials, only to be saved by the mysterious woman, Haruka Shitow. When Ayato learns that those government officials have blue blood, Haruka promises him the truth that has been kept from him for so long, only for him to run from her to chase after a mysterious girl by the name of Reika Mishima with whom he stumbles on a giant egg that holds the RahXephon, an ancient mechanical titan  than can only be piloted by Ayato. With this, he learns that there is a separate world, right outside the one he's lived in all his life, with a 12 year difference to that of Tokyo's time. With Haruka and the anti-Mu organization TERRA, Ayato will find the truth. About the RahXephon, about the Mu, and, most importantly, about himself.  
           
          As you can tell by that not-so-brief description, there is a lot going on in RahXephon. It's a series filled with lore, mystery, and symbolism that is just begging to be answered and analyzed, yet the series always chooses to hold close to it's chest. The show always gives you enough to work off of, and plenty to keep you interested, but the answers come quite slowly, and there are plenty of times where you're left in a state of confusion where you simply have to sit down for a minute or ten, and think about what you just saw. This makes it such a joy when you finally do get those answers and everything finally comes together, but so frustrating to actually continue on with. Many will find themselves fascinated with the show, and invested to find out it's secrets, but there are plenty that simply get fed up with being kept in the dark. This is understandable, but RahXephon is definitely a series worth sticking with, and and even greater joy to revisit, once you know all the secrets, and realize that the show gave you a lot more to work with than you gave it credit for.  
         
        RahXephon is a show doused with Mayan lore and Aztec culture, mixed in with the studies of the fictional continent of Mu, thought up by James Churchwood, plenty of classic literature influence, and plenty of reference to surrealist art. But above all, RahXephon plays with the concept of music. Each episode ends with the words, ""The world, suffused with sound"", and many music terms are often brought up in cryptic riddles, for example. All because one of the main themes of RahXephon, is the idea of music changing the world, though put in a much more cryptic and spoiler-ish manner, and as such, the show itself plays out like a symphony, playing until it reaches it's coda, and ends with a striking crescendo.  
  
      But, while you may further enjoy the show with proper knowledge of it's influence, you don't need to know them to like the show. RahXephon is a cerebral art piece indeed, but it's primarily a romance that centers around revelation and inner strength. It shows how easy it is to come face to face with reality, how hard to is to accept it, and how strong you have to be to move past it in order to find happiness in the bonds that you spend time creating and strengthening, and while it may come with occasional heavy-handedness, the show itself it so genuine, honest, and respectful to it's audience with how it's presented, that those moments never dampen the show, and the shining moments are ones that will linger on with you for quite a while. 
 
Art (9/10) 
 
         RahXephon is brought to us by Studio BONES, a studio which few, if any, anime fans are unaware of. How could they be when BONES brought us some of the most noteworthy anime to come out, such as FMA and it's reboot FMA Brotherhood, Wolf's Rain, Eureka Seven, Soul Eater, and Ouran High School Host Club. What some people might be unaware of though, is that RahXephon was one of their first works, and their first big success. While RahXephon is somewhat of a small title these days, it's possible that without it, BONES wouldn't have the same illustrious future. It seems that BONES may have been aware of this at the time of RahXephon's conception, because the show is beautiful, even by todays standards.  
         
        The show is surprisingly bright and colorful, despite it's ominous tone, brought out through the simple yet effective design of the island of Nirai-kanai where most of the show takes place, making it all the more relevant when the tone changes and the backgrounds go dim and eery. As a cerebral show, it loves it's share of symbolism and imagery, such as the ever present contrast of red and blue, the reappearing dove portrait, modeled after Rene Magritte's ""La Grand Famille"", the use of common day items as representation of characters emotions, such as windshield wipers and a chime. But the most distinct aspects of the art in the show has to be the character designs, done by Akihiro Yamada. It's often said that body language speaks louder than words, and RahXephon has proven, possibly more than any other show, that animation is no exception. It's almost baffling just how expressive these characters are. The show says more in it's character expressions more than some shows say in entire series worth of dialogue, and some more subtle touches, like someone taking a few seconds to look someone in the eye, or just a look that the camera panders on for a second or two too long, can almost tell you everything you need to know about that character.  
        
       The show doesn't slack in the animation department either. In fact, i wouldn't say that it'd be too much of a long shot to say that some parts of the show rival that of modern theatrical releases. But there are two reasons why this section doesn't get a perfect score. The first being the actions scenes. The animation for the action scenes isn't bad, far from it in fact, and the designs for the dolems are actually quite eye-catching, but it doesn't really have the cool factor that you find in most mech fights, and can be a bit formulaic. The second reason is episode 20, which was outsourced to another studio, and looks positively dreadful. Mind you, it's the only episode that looks dreadful, but that simply makes it all the more noticeable. Still, what the show delivered in visuals is far exceeded expectations, and made for a defining point in the career of one of anime's most beloved studios.  
 
Sound (10/10) 
 
       To match the show's outstanding visuals, the soundtrack provides a score of equal quality. RahXephon's OST was composed by Ichiko Hashimoto, providing a divisive score, mostly orchestral pieces, where every song stands out from the other and fits the visuals of the show perfectly, but because of this if actually hard to describe, and you'd be best listening to some tracks yourself and then judging it.  
        
       As for dub vs sub, you can't go wrong with either one, but they actually provide fairly different experiences. The Japanese track is very subtle and sedated, bringing in some real talent with names like Hiro Shimono, Aya Hisakawa, and, my personal favorite, Maaya Sakamoto, each presenting great performances. The dub on the other hand, is actually a little clunky at first, with some performances starting off rather rough, but eventually evolves into one of the better dubs you could possibly listen to, with Chris Patton and Monica Rial giving possibly their best performances to date with their respective roles as Ayato and Haruka. Unlike the Japanese dub, it's much more emotional, and more fitting to a drama. Both tracks cater ideally to the show, but in different ways, so it really all comes down to personal preference. RahXephon is a show that centers around sound, so it's only fitting that the sound for the show itself comes out with near perfection. 
 
Character (10/10) 
  
        RahXephon is a story of love, determination, realization, and acceptance. These are themes that can only get across with a great sense of humanity in it's cast. Luckily, RahXephon delivers fully in that category. The characters follow archetypal designs for it's cast, with Ayato being the calm competent protagonist, Haruka being the protective older woman, Quon being the mysterious doll like girl, so on so forth. But there's one thing that evolve them far past these tropes and labels into something so much more. Their interactions. No line of this show is unimportant, and often, when one character says one thing, they're actually saying 10 different things. It may sound simple, but to achieve it to the level that RahXephon has done is far from an easy task.  
 
        By the end of it, these characters seem lot less like works of fiction, and more like actual people, complex with genuine desires, motivations, attitudes, and feelings. It's this that makes a simple fanservice character like Sayako into a tragic case of solitude and unrequited feelings, or a despicable character like Isshiki into a pitiful being of inadequacy and unfilled hopes. While there are some standout characters, like Maya Kamina, who is one of the best maternal characters period, or Johji Futagami, whose basic role in the series is to just keep being awesome, you'll be hard-pressed to find just one favorite character, as there's something to love and adore in nearly all of them. Similar to how i liked the School Days ending because it gave the characters exactly what it deserved, i love RahXephon's ending because it does the same. Only in this case, it takes an incredible cast of characters, shows them true suffering, but eventually gives them the fate that they had deserved right from the beginning.  
 
Evangelion Comparison 
 
       In reviews, it's rarely a good thing to compare the work you're reviewing to another work. To be honest, i didn't really want to have to address the RahXephon/Evangelion comparison, but the show has become so associated with Evangelion, that it's almost impossible to avoid. RahXephon came out years after Evangelion, giving the world of mech anime the boost that they needed, and one that would've be given again until the release of Gurren Lagann years afterwards. Since it's release, RahXephon has often been compared to Evangelion by fans and critics alike, some saying that it's an improved version of Evangelion, while others label it as a blatant rip off. Both of these, i highly disagree with.  
 
     What makes something a rip off, is when a work tries to ride the coattails of another popular work because the writers simply lack the talent to make something of their own. RahXephon, is an original work with superficial similarities to Evangelion, but is practically it's opposite in themes, tone, and execution. But even if they weren't, would it really matter? Does it matter that the show in front of your face got it's idea from something else, when it provides you a smart, well-written, and emotional story? To some people, it does, and you can spend your time moaning and groaning about it on forums and message boards. But, i will be spending that time watching a fantastic show. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall (10/10) 
 
        RahXephon is an anime that has been all but forgotten, in the West and in Japan. But even so, it has it's own loyal fan base that continues to support the show even to this day, and i am proud to call myself one of them. RahXephon has it's flaws and could be considered a bit esoteric to some, but it's imperfections only make it more beautiful in my eyes. RahXephon is my favorite anime, and i doubt that any other show will be taking it's place anytime soon. Anyways, that's all for now. Til next time.

    After finishing this series and having read a few reviews of this Anime; I have a different view, a different perspective of this Anime. 
 
I just can't agree with the high numbers given to this Anime. I respect their opinions obviously; but here is my opinion: 
 
Quite bluntly said, it was very disappointing. 
 
After the first few episodes it is quite easy to agree on this Anime being one of those you enjoy watching. The animation is so-so, but the story is pretty like able since it's being told pretty nicely. Not literally told; but the process in general is well done. 
 
My compliments on that, RahXephon.  
 
However, the downfall of this Anime came closer the more the plot came closer to me, the viewer. You see; an Anime can't expect to get a high rating while all they did was complicate a complicated story; thus confusing the viewer. 
 
Many things are really badly explained; not to mention that besides this, many things that are part of the story start annoying you. 
 
For instance, all these weird looking mechas sing. It's part of the story; I get that much. But after a while; after hearing them singing over and over, episode in and out with that weird noise. It annoys you, irritates you and pretty much 'forces' you to skip that part. 
 
Yes, that's true. I've skipped parts. Why? 
It's simple; the story wasn't convincing enough and became a nuisance. 
 
The complicater the story isn't the better. Neither is complicating the images and scenes as well. Vague images appear; nothing much gets explained. Sure, one vague image gets explained. But what about the other ones. What was his motive? 
Why this, why that? 
 
So many answers were unanswered; and for a series that has 26 episodes and a pretty good concept it just didn't quite make it. It's unacceptable. 
 
You see, the characters were pretty good. But why complicate things more? 
For instance, there were over 10 love interests for whoever and whatever in the serie. If I try to recall; I can mention at least 3 people one person had his eyes on, one after the other. Some of them don't even make sense and are quite hard to get. Why was this put in?.. and why so vaguely? Is this reality or isn't it? 
 
If only they made the story clearer; this would've actually been good. Though some things get clearer after you watch the movie; it is still not a part of the original tv series. Thus doesn't count. As for this one; it's too confusing that only the first half of this series is actually fulfilling. Many things I was able to guess and foresee. Maybe that's because the story put the concept of one great dramatic scene, not once, but more than three times into the story. That's right, the same exact concept is used; opening my eyes was easy and I was able to see a pattern. And I'm supposed to be dense. Not to mention that the designs of the ending are quite bad. But hey, that's just taste. Too bad the story has nothing to do with taste. 
 
The only thing I really liked of this Anime in a whole was the female lead character; though it is discussable if she really is the female lead. But well, she was my only reason of enjoying the last 8 episodes. And even she gets vagued out. So useless and random; I just can't see how making the story more vague this much is thought of to be interesting, good, developing, mysterious and great. Since it just doesn't makes any sense. 
 
As for the series in general, and if you should watch it. 
Well, if you are bored and really want to watch an anime reasonably enjoyable, go ahead. But don't expect much of the story or try to crack your brain; things get explained in the end (partially). It's easy to get; just doesn't makes any sense. So don't worry about thinking things through; the story really did turn crap near the end. At least the ending wasn't sucky right. And I did enjoy this anime for a bit; especially the first half. 
 
So yeah, your choice, your time. Just make sure to not blame me if you didn't like it; many people do seem to like it here though, check the other reviews ratings.

    RahXephon is a Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Romance, Drama about a high school boy Ayato Kamina, who believes in the reality that is present before him. However everything changes once he discovers the truth about the world, that humanity is at war. 
 
From the very beginning you will be thrown right into the thick of it, knowing very little about the plot, story and overall premise. However as the show goes on it slowly reveals, bit by bit, what it is all about, which is about humanity's struggle against some weird invaders. The story is told well because everything is straight forward and you won&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed with the back story and all the terms given. However this anime series may lack some originality because it is not too difficult to spot the numerous parallels between RahXphon and the ever-so-popular Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both series about boys being thrust into a war against unknown beings, plus having romantic interest on the side. Nonetheless, RahXephon does manage to become an anime of its own. 
 
The characters are fairly well-defined and well developed but only Ayato Kamina stands out, as the protagonist. Yet every episode usually focuses on one of the supporting characters, developing them further. Nevertheless there are times when the characters&rsquo; actions and thoughts are confusing or just don&rsquo;t make any sense.  
 
The animation and music quality is the sort of thing to expect from BONES. Even though the animation style is somewhat dated, the way in which everything from the amazing fights to just simple talks is animated so well. Whereas the music adds to the impact of the action and drama, seeing that music is a major element in the show. Yet the music does get fairly repetitive. 
 
Overall RahXephon has proven to be a Mecha anime worthy of being included in any mecha anime fan&rsquo;s collection. The combat is pretty impressive and so is the musical score, which goes well with the artistic concept. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a tough show to understand however at times things end up being explained poorly, which can confuse us viewers making the show less enjoyable to watch. I recommend this anime to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have anything against Mecha anime.

    Overall/Enjoyment: 
Where to begin. First the disclaimer: RahXephon is definitely not for everyone. It's usually best to have little to no expectations so as to not contaminate the experience. With RX there are some things you should, and a lot of things you should NOT, expect. 
 
I would be remiss if I didn't mention how significantly challenging of a show it is to get into. You certainly have to be in the right mood/mindset for it. It is easy to label this show as an action, drama, sci-fi mecha romance (or whatever), but what does any of that mean? If you've seen Neon Genesis Evangelion, expect this show to have a very familiar... setting. This is usually the first thing people notice (and usually complain about). Mecha is probably the least important aspect of this show however. The story is also very heavily character driven, so the pacing is very slow and the action is sparse. Coupled with this, the sci-fi aspects of the show are limited and more of a sub-plot if anything. At its heart however RX is ripe with drama and romance, but above all else, it is a very well written and a stunningly artistic show. 
 
That being said, if you are the kind of person who likes to analyze things and gestate them and appreciate the fine art in works, then RX has a lot to offer. This is not to say that RX is an intellectual tour de force meant only for the highest of brows, but rather as a hint for people who like that kind of stuff. If this is not your style or what you are in the mood for, then there is a very good chance you will find this show simply boring, meaningless, and/or just an inferior version of NGE.  
 
I initially tried to watch this show with my brother and we were both wondering ""when does anything cool happen?"" Some months later I tried watching the show again, by myself this time, late at night. Under these conditions I was able to just sit back and enjoy what was going on. So I definitely recommend watching this under similar settings where you have time to view at least a few episodes and focus on them. 
 
 
Story: 
There's not really much to say about the story that isn't covered in any synopsis. There are elements of mystery that can be confusing at times, but get more or less resolved/explained eventually (with minor exceptions). Some of the temporal ideas they play with are kind of interesting. The way information is revealed is pretty well done. You slowly get immersed into the world(s) and things become more intriguing and entertaining the more you get to know the characters. What's more, it actually has a conclusive and COHERENT ending, which is more than I can say for the majority of anime. There's nothing I hate more than getting really into a series only to have it end in some crazy, sudden, ambiguous, and/or arbitrary manner. I HATE THAT SO MUCH. *deep breath* Ok, so, stories with good endings get high marks from me. I can't really say what it was I liked so much about the ending without essentially spoiling it, but suffice to say I found it very.... emotionally satisfying. 
 
Do not be fooled. Even though the Japanese love to throw robots into almost everything, RahXephon is scarcely a mech show except in the most token of ways. The fights involving mechs are brief and mostly forgettable. They really serve more of a symbolic and artistic purpose than any kind of technical combative entertainment. This is most prominently exemplified in episodes 19 and 26. The sci-fi part of the story is mostly nonsense, but it's very pretty looking and sounding nonsense. This is what really counts here. It doesn't matter if the plot is silly or has been done before, what matters most isn't what is said but HOW it is told. The real story lies beneath the surface of the sci-fi mecha mumbo jumbo, and if this isn't clear by the end then you've really missed something. 
 
 
NGE vs. RX: 
If you've already seen Neon Genesis Evangelion then you might be put off by how strikingly similar this show appears to be. It's true; the parallels between RahXephon and NGE are uncomfortably pervasive. They both have a young male lead thrust into piloting a mech for some organization to fight against abstract enemies. They both have an older female character who introduces and protects/shelters the main character. They both take place, obviously, in (post-destruction) Tokyo and of course are mankind's last hope against a prevailing alien threat. Coincidences like these will probably catch your eye throughout the show, however, RX is not the blatant ripoff one might think. These common threads are superficial and are no more egregious than two shows having the same ""harem of girls fawning over an awkward guy"" plot. 
 
Here's where the shows stop being similar: NGE provided a more realistic mech story with deep psychological overtones and Christian themed undertones; RX centers around capturing a certain... aesthetic more than anything else. So if you are going to watch RX, it is important to bear in mind that the thing you'll take away most from it is not the ""edge of your seat action"" or the ""mind blowing concepts"" but one thing: aesthetics. Here RX triumphs over NGE most magnificently; it is simply and stunningly beautiful. 
 
 
Art: 
The character designs put me off a little bit in the beginning. There was something so simple and plain about them that didn't sit right with me. Their colors were too solid and too flat. The designs are definitely different, and after a while I either grew used to them or stopped caring, because everything else about the art in RX is just amazing. The time and effort they put into the backgrounds are absolutely breathtaking. The other thing I liked about RX is that even though the enemies are abstract looking, they're not just weird floating giant eyeballs or anything obnoxious like that. The abstraction in RX actually retains a certain ""realistic"" genuine design, they look like something someone might actually build.  
 
Sound: 
I'd say the sound in this series shares in the same spirit of aesthetics. I mean, how could it not? The plot revolves around the idea of a world suffused with sound. If you are spinning a story that is largely character driven and are trying to immerse the viewer in visuals then it is equally important that the music draws them in as well. Some of the melodies are really solid/memorable, but the most important part is that the mood and tones are always set just right. Since music/sound is supposed to be a big theme of the show, it would've been nice if there had been more distinguishable harmonic singing as opposed to the mostly tonal chanting that goes on. In this area I don't feel they really tapped into their full potential beauty and the incessant droning can get a little annoying... 
 
The Op/En themes were alright, maybe a little too tranquil for my tastes. The dubbing was surprisingly good. I usually watch an episode or so dubbed and then watch a couple subbed before deciding how to watch the series, but the dub was so well done that the thought to switch over never even came to me. This is not to say it was flawless, Vic Mignogna's voice didn't seem to quite fit, but whatever. Comparing it to the subtitling, I might even go as far as saying that the dubbing was possibly better... 
 
 
Characters: 
The main character is a refreshing alternative to your typical amoral badass or whiny, obnoxious brat. No stupid sidekicks or comic relief here, no retarded antics and none of the usual cliche archetypes that make up your usual lineup. Most of the characters are really well done, a few of the minor characters could've been better developed, but they're all fairly believable and likable. With the exception of Makoto, who is just an unbelievable prick. It's never really explained why he's such an insufferable douche bag either. This ultimately doesn't matter, some people are just bastards for no good reason, but it would've been nice if at least A reason was given. In fact, it would've been better if some of the characters motives had been elaborated on more. 
 
If you've seen and liked Eureka 7 (also by Bones) then you already have an idea about what a story driven by wonderful characters is like. Of course, having good characters alone is not what makes this show unique. More so than the visuals or the sound, where RahXephon really excels is how heart warmingly romantic it is. I don't mean this in some cheesy, lovey-dovey, soap opera kind of way. It's somewhat hard to explain. You can watch this show and not even pick up on it, but that's part of the magic. It's not overdone and it's sort of subtle about it but still effective. 
 
Even the characters are beautiful in a way. I hate stories where characters act or react in ways that have no bearing to real life, so when they interact believably it just makes it that much more enjoyable for me. Let's take harem shows for instance where the main male lead is either painfully oblivious to (or shows no interest in) any of his would-be female suitors. Or, when there's some ridiculously breasted female character (and there's a lot of them in anime) and people just act as if it's the norm, when you know, YOU KNOW, every single male (and lesbian?) eye would be locked on to that woman all-the-time; everywhere she went. I HATE when shows do that. 
 
So I was SO glad to see RahXephon took that extra step to make the characters feel more real rather than just inundate the viewer with more of the usual idealistic/innocent baloney -- and I'll always love it for that. The characters are so sincere and so genuine with one another that it made watching them gripping. In that same vein of realism, I absolutely loved how... amorous the characters were. You'll see scenes where cleavage might catch someone's eye, or where there will be an air of sexual tension, or proximity promiscuity, and all these other sensual elements that were deliciously but tastefully mature. This extra layer made the characters so much more... human. I really loved this about the show, and it is probably what I'll remember most: just how playful and fun and passionate and real they appeared to be. So by the time I got to the end, it was such a memorable and moving journey that I was sad when it was over. The characters were just so alluring and endearing. 
 
 
Other: 
There are a lot of mysteries in the show I never understood like who Kamina's parents were, or how Haruka found him at that gateway after the disappearance, or the whole clone craziness, or the whole elaborate setup at the end, or why the mu were on earth or where they came from... but none of that really matters. I can't really do justice to how much I liked this show, but there's a review of it on ANN that puts it into much better words than I have. This is a show anyone who values substance owes to themselves to watch.

    To start off, I'm going to say I am not a big mecha fan. All I knew when I started this series was that it was a mecha/sci-fi/action anime that some of my friends looked down upon due to its unfavorable comparisons to Neon Genesis Evangaleon (which I haven't seen). Other than that, I had no idea what I was in for, and that's how I like it. What I got, in short, was a surprisingly great show, well made, that really grew on me very quickly. 
 
STORY: The story can be the weakest part for some people, it isn't simple or linear, but, I think, it's not too, too complicated. You are in Ayato's shoes at the start, and it's very understandable to be confused as to what's going on. With a little faith and some brain power, keep going forward and it'll all be revealed if you keep your eyes open. The story is woven well and, without giving much away, I'll say that it's about Ayato's journey to learn about: the world he's in, the real world, who he is/was, who the giant flying robots are, and what his purpose is in relation to the people around him. Vague, right? I know, this area is pretty sketchy, and intentionally so. The story is deep, the story is more than slightly convoluted, and the story is good. Give it a chance. 8/10. 
 
ART: One of the things I instantly liked about this show was the art. I knew this anime hadn't come out yesterday and, despite being a guy who just has to have what's new and now, I really liked the animation. The colors are great, everything is well drawn, with special detail to the mechas (which, surprisingly, some mecha animes overlook, go figure). I didn't find anything that really stood out as bland and there were few- if any- weak points in the animation. It didn't feel dated at all despite having come out 6 years ago. 9/10. 
 
SOUND: The Opening/Ending to RahXephon really caught my ears, just like the art caught my eye. The ending theme is beautiful, and sent me to sleep (in a good way) more than once while watching the episodes back to back. The music always fits the mood, the sound effects are great, and a lot of the tracks are lovable. Indeed, one of the 'themes' of the show is about sound, and there's a bit about singing, which I won't get into unless I want to get into spoiler-land, but Sound is definitely one of RahXephon's strong points. The voice acting is top notch, if you're someone like me who always wonders whether to bother with the dub, well I loved it. Ayato's voice was great, the supporting character's were pretty good, and Vic Mignogna was... well, he's Vic Mignogna. 10/10. 
 
CHARACTER: Second to Sound, here's where the series shines the most. And yet it gets an 8- why? Because of the unavoidable connections between Character and Story. The complexities of the Story mixed with the large cast of characters sometimes made it hard to keep track of who was who, something I found really disappointing. Also, aside from Ayato and the main, let's say other two, it was difficult to tell who the main characters really were. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, but the ambiguity, imo, could have been handled a little better. Nonetheless, the characters themselves, once you've gotten to know them, will blow you away. I really connected with Ayato and many of the supporting cast. A lot of them are deep and, over the course of the series go through so many intense emotional periods, the most passionate parts of their lives. You see them at their best and their worst, really getting to know them, and though it can get kind of tricky keeping track of them all, you'll definitely have an opinion of them if nothing else. 8/10. 
 
ENJOYMENT: I really don't know what it was. Could it have been the 'artsy' undertones? The score, the production, the characterization? Or maybe I'm just a mecha fan underneath who hasn't come out of his shell, I don't know, but what I do know is: I really, really liked RahXephon, and I put it up there in my top 3 favorite animes ever. I forget how I stumbled across it, really, but I'm glad I did. What began as a way to kill time ended as really something of an experience. I understand this series has many parallels to NGE (see above), and after watching this I started to understand why NGE fans so vigorously shoved it into my face, for I was doing the same with RahXephon. You COULD say having to watch the series a second time to understand everything counts as replay value, maybe, but who knows? I know I didn't fully get everything on the first go around (which is really what keeps this thing from truly, truly being perfect). 9/10. 
 
OVERALL (aka: tl;dr version): 
STORY: Ayato's journey of self discovery takes him into his own mind and places far beyond. Well written, but very complex; worth giving your full attention. 8/10. 
ART: Fluid, beautifully done, smooth and nicely drawn animations that keep your attention. 9/10. 
SOUND: Amazing English dubbing, and the japanese voices are nothing short of what you'd expect either. Spectacular music, OP/ED, and overall great OST/sound effects. 10/10. 
CHARACTER: A (perhaps too) large and real cast of characters, very real, very human, that may or may not make or break the series for you. 8/10. 
ENJOYMENT: I'm not sure on this one. Watch the first, let's say 6 or 7 episodes, wait for things to really get rolling, and if you don't like it/are totally lost/absolutely hate it, don't watch it. I for one could not stop watching this anime. 9/10. 
 
So how do two 8's, two 9's, and a 10 average out to an overall 10? I have no idea, but I cannot recommend this anime strongly enough. It truly is a work of art. 
 
[This was my first review; if you did not find it helpful, please let me know. I'm always happy to talk about this series!]

    Amagami ss: it's a great gimmick and an overall great series, definitely one of the best romantic anime out there. 
 
Story: Basically the male protagonist, junichi, was stood up two years ago on a date during christmas leaving him ""emotionally scarred"" in terms of love. 
This year, maybe he can start a relationship with one of the 6 girls in his school, so finally he can start a new romantic relationship. 
Each arc has 4 episodes focused on one girl, and the next arc starts from scratch and focuses on a new girl. 
This is clever, so if you don't like one girl, you can find another. 
This wash, rinse, repeat gimmick is excellent and very fresh, however a con is the relationships and character development can only be built up from a limited amount of episodes; some relationships really needed more episodes to do it justice. 
8/10 
 
Art: Animation was lively, detailed and colourful, but nothing that's really outstanding or new. 
It's simply good, though not excellent. 
The character designs are quite generic, but attractive and good-looking nontheless 
8/10 
 
Sound: Voice acting is great (sub only) but the music is quite bland and forgettable. 
6/10 
 
Character: All the female leads are very interesting and fleshed out, and entertaining and attractive to the male demographic in their respective ways. 
However, the main complaint from me for the anime was the male lead, Junichi. 
The best way to describe him is that he's ""an ahole but not 100% a dick"" 
He was extremely bland, clichè and unlikable in most arcs. 
The main reason i dislike him is that sometimes he likes the girl purely on her looks and dates her only for, well, kisses. 
He's also a bit of a pervert. 
He's not an unbearable character, but he acts a bit like a douchebag in 2 particular arcs; if i was with any of these girls there is no way i would act like he does. 
The creators really should've made a character that was much nicer, and a character that you can tell was truly emotionally scarred from a date two years ago. 
To his credit, there are certain arcs where he was ok, such as kaoru's arc. 
Main reason for this was their very good and dynamic chemistry. 
Other side characters, such as junichi's sister and his best friend, are very likable and entertaining. 
If i were to score the female characters i'd give this category 10/10....however since junichi counts so i'd score this 8/10. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I've enjoyed all the arcs so far, however be wary that this anime does have some awkward, stupid and cringe-worthy moments.  
One confession scene also felt out-of-the-blue, misplaced, too early and frankly, too cheesy (ai Nanasaki), however this doesn't really take much enjoyment out if the series. 
8/10 
 
Overall, this is an entertaining romance series and i highly reccomend it to romance genre fans. 
However, be wary of the four episode limit and the fact that the main lead isn't a very good character (well, he's still leagues better than Makoto from school days haha) 
8/10

    As always, I'll keep this brief. This show is like hot-cocoa, or just the right amount of alcohol. You know exactly what you're getting. There is nothing exotic, no subversion's. It would be easy to have too much, and would get old if it was the only thing you drank. But at the right time, for the right mood, it's perfect. It make you feel warm, familiar, comforted, relaxed, guaranteed to make you smile. Think cold Christmas nights, comfortable at home, in pleasant company, snuggled with a cup of hot-cocoa or hard egg-nog.  
 
Dropping the metaphor, this show won't surprise you. There is little comedy or conflict, with characters you've seen a hundred times. Yet, I consider these strengths, in this case. Maybe it's the mood I'm in, but it's nice to have something to watch that won't twist my emotions, rile me up with laughs, scare or upset me. It's just dumb-kids falling in ""love"" with each other. It's cute, heartwarming, and makes me happy. Should you watch it? I guess it depends. If you want to turn off your cynicism, and just drown in sappy love, then this is how you do it.

    6 Arcs. 6 Girls. And an extra one episode of a bonus girl. 
 
That's what Amagami SS is. 
 
Each arc is 4 episodes, and every arc is like another route you chose in the dating sim. Every time another girl. So you watch 4 episodes, and then at episode 5 you get back to the starting point, but the main character (Let's shorten it to MC) will be friendly and get closer to another girl. (Even though all characters are seen from the first minutes) 
 
On the one hand, if there's an arc you hate, you know it's over quickly (as it's only 4 episodes) but on the other hand if there's an arc you like.. Well you won't be getting more episodes for that.  
 
Also, most arcs follow the same pattern. So that gets kind of boring after a while. 
 
I'd like to divide each arc and review it by itself. The order will be from what I liked the most to the least. In each arc I'll say a sentence about the opening (how the arc started, ep 1), the progression (the development in episodes 2-3 of the arc) and the ending of the arc (ep 4). 
 
Nanasaki Ai- 9/10 
 
Nanasaki Ai is a friend of Miya(MC's sister). 
 
Opening- Ai and MC haven't met beforehand. The opening was extremely random and kinda forced. 
 
Progression- Even with the weird opening, it developed pretty well in such a short time. 
 
Ending- Pretty good, But I would've liked to see more. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Ayatsuji Tsukasa- 7.5/10 
 
Ayatsuji is the class president, she has talked with MC a few times before. They're in the same class. 
 
Opening- Actually it was pretty good, it didn't feel forced. 
 
Progression- Messed up, rushed. So many questions, so much complexity. Too much for a short arc of 4 episodes. Altogether, it was still cute. 
 
Ending- Quite nice, I was still in a shock of what happened beforehand, but it was nice. The ending by itself was good. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Tanamachi Kaoru- 7/10 
 
Kaoru is MC's friend for about 5 years. But nothing romantic for these years. 
 
Opening- Extremely fine, nothing too exciting. 
 
Progression- Cute, nothing more, nothing less. 
 
Ending- The first part of the ending is nice, but after that... nothing, no good. It leaves too much that I do not know. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Nakata Sae- 6/10 
 
Sae is another friend of Miya. 
 
Opening- Random, but not forced, it felt completely fine. 
 
Progression- Here lies the problem, two random people, different by all means, somehow getting together? That IS forced. But how they spent their time together, what they did together was not forced. 
 
Ending- It was fine, Not much. I've read the ending for the dating sim, It's a lot better. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Morishima Haruka- 4.5/10 
 
Morishima-senpai is a senior, older than MC by one year. 
 
Opening- Random encounter. That's it. 
 
Progression- No. Just no. It was awkward, cringey, embarrasing. It made me pause every 20 seconds and question myself what the hell am I watching. 
 
Ending- Was really good. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Sakurai Rihoko- 2/10 
 
Ah yes. Childhood friend. Every anime needs that ""Childhood friend who always loved MC"". That's Rihoko. 
 
Opening- She already knew MC for a long time, so there wasn't much of an opening. 
 
Progression- It was more focused on other things, unlike the romance with the other girls in other arcs. It was not interesting. 
 
Ending- Eh I guess? The ending they did was fine. Better than the second option which would've been extremely forced. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
Other honorable mentions: Umehara, MC's best friend. Too bad I couldn't see more of him. He seemed like a really cool guy. 
 
And as for the ""extra"", 25th episode. That was a mistake. 
 
Meet Risa, an extremely random girl, who decided to have her arc shortened to one episode.  It was a random girl who came, then decided to crush every other arc you liked (or not) and say ""Hey, I'm the main girl now!"". 
 
My opinion of the show would've been better without her. 
 
And as for MC himself- Junichi. He is not really interesting. Generic pervert guy. He is a bit dense at first, but understands and grasps the situation. At least he doesn't bleed every time he sees a girl. 
 
_______________________________ 
 
As for other aspects: The sound and art were nothing great. 6 for Art as it's fine and 4 for sound as I don't remember any good OST or OP/ED from it. 
 
If I make an average of all the arcs- I'll get to the score of 6. I'll give it a 6.5 tho.

    I am sure that most of you that I have heard about Amagami SS is because of its unique omnibus format, same as me. The omnibus format is, to summarize, a visual novel-style anime, not only an adaption of a visual novel. A set amount of episodes is dedicated for each arc and after each arc, time is ""reset"" to allow the story to follow a different route. After watching Amagami SS, I can say that the format is great. 
 
Amagami SS is your typical romance story set in a high school setting and lacking the supernatural happenings that most other stories wants to incorporate with varying success. The story stars Junichi Tachibana, an, in most senses, a typical guy that through various events tries to improve his love life. His potential love interests, which the anime cycles through, possess standard Japanese traits. School idols, childhood friend, kohai, senpai, tsundere, most of which many has seen in other series. 
 
Now here is what Amagami SS is great. The story is cliche Japanese high school romance, but it's actually romance! Thanks to the omnibus format, the story can progress where the protagonist and his love interest actually gets closer and every heroine gets a resolution. This is a very refreshing change to the dozens of harem anime where the protagonist is super dense yet every girl wants him but nobody gets him in the end. As such, the story can actually focus on the romance aspect instead of the fanservice. Seeing the resolution of the arcs can be really heart-warming, since every arc has Junichi evolve from his depressive self to someone reliable.  
 
This anime reminded me of how much I love cliche anime romance story, as long as they have resolutions. As an avid visual novel reader, I am also satisfied over the dividation and focus of the separate story arcs. Four episode per arc can feel somewhat short, but every arc contains enough story, development and fluffiness that I can feel it is enough. I do hope one day that the omnibus format will be a more viable option for visual novel adaptions, since we all know what a disaster those can be if they follow a linear route. 
 
So anyone that loves romance, and I mean real romance, and/or likes visual novels, romance or not, and/or wants to try something new, this anime is definitely something I recommend.

    This is the series that induced countless sleepless nights. 
 
This was the first omnibus-format anime I watched. The best thing about this format is that multiple mutually-exclusive story arcs can be incorporated. The major drawback is the compacted story line which will leave you craving for more. 
 
After looking at the thumbnail picture, I thought, ""maybe one of those harem anime again"". But after watching the first arc, which is in my opinion the best arc, I found myself having this strange feeling of wanting to watch MORE knowing the sun is starting to rise up!!! 
 
In terms of artwork, I think it is arguably one of the best. But it is funny to point out that I can interchange Tsukasa and Morishima on a bad hair day. 
 
The first opening and ending theme resounded in my head for a couple of days. Every arc has their own ending theme, which is a good feature. It makes every arc personalized and completely independent from each other. Well i dunno if you also have that feeling but I strongly do. 
 
Of course, not all arcs are good. I mean, they are good but there are MUCH better ones. Morishima, Rihoko and Tsukasa arcs are the worthwhile ones. Kaoru arc is a little less than a common love story. Sae-Junichi pair i think is a no-no. Nanasaki arc is somewhat ecchi and she's only first year! 
 
This anime was an adaptation of a dating simulation game. Too bad i didn't have the chance to play it. But i have enough experience in playing one though. One thing that i would like to see in case of a future installment are the better, good and worst endings of each arc. That would be fun. 
 
And yes, let us talk about the seiyuus. Kaoru's seiyuu is a natural. Morishima and Tsukasa's are exceptional. Sae's is a little weird. The shi-shi in Miya's laugh reminds me of Thriller Bark arc of One Piece. 
 
Character development is ""open"" for more development. Due to the compacted story line, their personalities are often neglected for love story progression and in some cases, the reverse.. It would have been better, i think, if they just made it a multiple seasoned anime to delimit the focus. 
 
Overall, I would give this series a 10/10. Not because it is the best, but it tried to. This anime is highly recommended if you're into love story. The rewatch rating highly depends on which arc to watch again.

    So i just finished the first arc of Amagami, the Haruka arc. Lets start with the first episode. It gives you a vague and rather rushed introduction of the volley of girls that you have awaiting you while you progress through the show, but as of now, our ""hero"" Junichi is completely head over heels with this seemingly perfect specimine of a highschool girl. So, in this arc, that's who he's chasing. This episode leaves a sort of sour taste in your mouth, since it ends on an extremely negative note. Now, there are only 4 episodes to get you started on before they go on to the next girl, and i must say that these guys quite skillfully puta lot of heart and nterest into making sure the viewer has strong feelings for Haruka, but whether these feelings are positive or negative is soley up to the viewer himself. As you watch this arc, you definately know how you'd feel if Junuchi actually stuck with this girl. After watching all 4 episodes dedicated to Haruka, i have made my conclusion on her, and the intro to the series in general; 
 
Storyline (Haruka arc), 8/10: Brief, but informative. By the end, you'll feel like you know them. 
 
Art [8/10]: In my opinion, this art is pretty professionally done. The color are sheek, and the shading makes the characters come to life. 
 
Sound [7/10]: By sound, i am picturing the music. The intro is slow, and the  
ending follows suit. I would constantly find myself skipping through the intro to get straight to the show itself, because i would be afraid that i'd be too busy crying to watch the storyline unfold. The ending starts off kind of slow, but it picks up later to a catchy tune that can easily be sung along to (if you speak japanese, that is). 
 
Characters [9/10]: A wide variety of colorful characters is really what makes a good series for me, and this show definately delivers in that category. 
 
Overall, i give this show a 7/10. First episode, 7/10. Second and third episodes picks up with light hearted comedy and cute lovey-dovey antics, so 8/10. Fourth episode is so sweet it practically gave me diabetes. I wanted it to cutaway and find out that it was just a silly wet dream Junichi had, but i come to find that they are ACTUALLY SERIOUSLLY DOING THIS. I wanted to slap a 6/10 on them, but the 2nd and 3rd episodes barely made me cough them up a 7/10. So, in conclusion, I wil continue watching this show in the hopes that it will never sugar coat relationships ever again, and just stick to the moderately harsh/hilarious reality like in the middle of this arc. I'd reccomend this show mostly for girls, but also for guys that like some sugar in their coffee every once on a while.

ARC 1: 
1. Some back of the knee fetishishing stuff involving puppies 
2. NYAN 
3. Hostage scenario ramen feeding in public cafeteria 
4. Pointless narrative excursions 
5. ONII CHAN MY SWEAT DROPS ARE MOVING ON THEIR OWN 
6. ""Senpai, why did you take me to this hotel where we're all alone and why did you take a bath and why have you turned out the lights, saying ""it's embarrassing"", and walked into the room with only a towel on? I honestly am dumbfounded and shocked by this turn of events and couldn't possibly think of a logical explaination for this. I'm going to make a stock ""shocked"" sound now."" EEEEEEEEEH?! 
7. Suddenly the girl starts crying 
 
I'm not feeling the romance, I'm not feeling anything but electric currents running through the copper veins under the cold metallic skins of the fucking robots on-screen. 
 
Maybe it's a cultural thing: Is this how people function, act, and respond in the country of japan? 
 
Whatever. As long as they have sex-hair girl and tits + ass I guess I can turn my brain off and derive some animal pleasure from this. 
 
Arc 2: 
Initially confused by the universe reset, I read some background and discovered that this was based on a dating game. Fucking figures. 
 
In any case this ""arc"" is much more enjoyable : they approach it from more of a comedy perspective so it's not so critically stupid. And sex hair is beyond delicious. 
 
Wasn't too hot for the bellybutton bullshit, though. Out of the blue... In a library?

Character: I will mention the girls shorly in 1-2 words, as they are only important for 4 episodes. :3

    Amagami SS is a romance anime which tells the story of Tachibana Junichi, a Japanese high school student who had shut himself away from relationships after being stood up, but manages to conveniently cease this once this anime begins. This is probably one of the most faithful adaptations of a visual novel, due to the fact that this anime is divided into separate routes for each of the characters, with each of the 6 arcs being 4 episodes each in Season 1, with 2 bonus single episode arcs for some side characters, and 2 episodes each in Season 2, with 1 minisode OVA for each of the main characters. 
 
On the whole, Amagami only has one thing really to draw anyone in, since the animation, soundtrack, voice acting, and everything else is exceptionally average, but it just so happens these characters are a sufficient saving grace, extenuating the mediocrity seen in other aspects of the show. While Junichi doesn't stand out from the generic self-insert anime MC, with the only real difference is his perversion used at times for the sake of humour, which while not that impressive, is a minor step up from the complete nothing of an MC who may as well wear a paper bag with a question mark on it, but no matter. The rest of the cast is far from generic. The notable members of the supporting cast are as follows: 
 
Haruka Morishima - Commonly referred to as just 'Morishima-senpai', she is in her last year, and is very popular, with many fans from all years. She is very fickle, indecisive, and has a strong liking for cute things, especially animals. She is a quarter English, and often will mix English phrases into her sentences. She is the first heroine Junichi encounters. 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi - Junichi's osananajimi and a tomboy, and she is in the same class as Junichi. She is insecure and uncertain of her feelings towards Junichi, but eventually becomes more comfortable with him. She is the second heroine Junichi encounters. 
 
Sae Nakata - Kohai to Junichi, and a friend of Miya and Ai. She is a very shy girl with large breasts. Her arc is the only one that is narrated and also really fucking boring, as much as she is. So boring that they had to get a narrator to remind me what was going on, and I feel like the director must agree with me, given that the first episode of her arc is titled 'Worst'. She is the third heroine Junichi encounters. 
 
Ai Nanasaki - Kohai to Junichi, and a friend of Miya and Sae. She is in the swimming club, and while not shy like Sae, she is still quiet, and does not speak much, but often uses deadpan when she does. She is the fourth heroine Junichi encounters. 
 
Rihoko Sakurai - Osananajimi to Junichi. She is a member of the Tea Club, and has an addiction to chocolates and sweets, but avidly tries to diet, with it ending in failure each time, however she is not particularly fat, presumptively due to Japanese beauty standards, as well as the fact actual obesity stops being moe. She is the fifth heroine Junichi encounters. 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji - Seito Kaichou of Junichi's class, she is a hard worker, often seen studying or helping out teachers. In actuality, she is rude, manipulative and controlling, and simply creates a facade, and she is much more controlling towards Junichi than any of the other characters. She is the sixth and final Junichi encounters, and also best girl. 
 
Miya Tachibana - Junichi's imouto. She refers to Junichi as 'Nii-nii', and has a fondness for meat buns (nikuman). She often mocks Junichi for not having a girlfriend and for watching lots of pornography, and has a distinctive laugh. She has a single episode arc at the end of Season 1. 
 
Umehara Masayoshi - Friend of Junichi. He is the son of an owner of a sushi restaurant, and often shares video games, idol magazines and pornography with Junichi. He refers to Junichi as 'Boss'. 
 
Hibiki Tsukahara - Friend of Haruka, and captain of the Swimming Club. She is much more mature than Haruka is, often having to keep her in line and acting as the straight man. 
 
Overall, Amagami SS is a very enjoyable show. The strong writing and excellent characters make for a strong experience, and one that is still enjoyable to watch today despite my multiple rewatches. When considering all the anime out there that put such an emphasis on their various moe characters, it's good to see one that actually makes them enjoyable, rather than bland flavours of the month that are immediately forgotten once the show stops airing.

    Amagami SS Review 
 
Presentation: 
The art of Amagami SS was pretty standard. I hate how the characters don't blink passively. It made some moments unnatural. They only blinks when they are performing an action. The sound design was standard as well. It was good but it did not made me go download the OSTs of the anime. I loved the first OP theme. It felt like one of those eroge video packages that presents the heroines. Even though the lyrics sounded so dull and typical, the video package saved it. I wish they kept the OP theme. It made me felt like I was about to play an eroge! They had different ending that fits the styles of the 6 heroines. I like the extra effort but I would rather have one solid ED theme than 7 different average ones. I love the voice over on this one. They did a great job on assigning them on the right character. 
 
Characters: 
There are a lot of them! Actually, too many for a single 25 episode season! Only 4 episodes on the main heroines and a bonus one?! The episodes were definitely QUALITY but I'd rather had a fewer arcs and more episodes to them. The main hero was normal with an overused name called ""Junichi."" Use another name for fucks sake! He looks too normal it pisses me off. Anyway, the heroines on the other hand was diverse to say the least. I enjoyed most of their personalities and differences. 
 
Story: 
It felt like an eroge, and a good one! I'll briefly state my opinions on each arcs. 
 
Morishima Arc - Probably the best arc they could start with. It got my attention with the first minute of the story. 
Kaoru Arc - Was sad when the first arc ended abruptly but this arc was unexpectedly good. 
Sae Arc - Shitty narrator. would have been much better without him. Start of the downfall. 
Nanasaki Arc - I was expecting more TSUN and less DERE. I was disappointed. 
Rihoko Arc - No progress, wasted episodes. at least they presented a different kind of ending. 
Ayatsuji Arc - Amazing arc. I was expecting something but it gave me something different. 
Bonus Arc - Deep story line for a solo episode. Was hoping for the BAD END and BLOODBATH. Too bad, maybe next time. 
 
I didn't like how it didn't had any sex scenes. Not even nipples on the BDs. Your an eroge. You audience are the perverted adults! So give us something to fap to! 
 
Verdict: 7.6/10 
+ Diverse characters 
+ Feels like an good dating sim 
- Too many arcs 
- No adult scenes 
 
Nikuman out of 10.

    Amagami SS is 25 episodes anime set in highschool setting and splitted into multiple story arcs. 
 
Story:8 
As mentioned above story is split into multiple arcs which are not connected and feature are lonely(slightly perverted) protagonist Junichi Tachibana trying to heal hes broken hearth and give love another try. 
 
Art:8 
Animation and art is consistent through out the show but some characters are kinda similar. 
 
Sound:7 
Sound is weakest part of Amagami since its forgettable and quite plain i found myself skipping OP and ED all the time. 
 
Characters:8 
Amagami features a vast cast of characters and menage to have every archetype that is seen in similar animes.There is  senior tsunderish character,fluffy girl,quiet and shy one,split personality and so on.Main protagonist Junichi is kind and slightly introvert in the begging due to events from first episode and through out show he's opening and changing. 
 
Enjoyment:8 
I enjoyed Amagami some arcs were better than some and all around it was a step up from generic highschool harem series. 
 
Overall:8 
I can safely recommend this show to any romance lover.this was Heralder and im out!

    Amagami ss in my opinion is a mess unless you really like short stories. I decided to give this anime a try without knowing it was really just full of 4 episode short stories so i was in for a big shock on episode 5 when they totally switch the main heroine. I felt cheated that I spent 2 hours really liking 1 character and then thats it and they have 5 other stories with him falling for another girl. I'd suggest just watch the first 4 episodes then stop and that'll be enough, or watch the first episode and if you don't like the girl pick one you like and skip to her 4 episodes. 
 
While it is an interesting idea to show all roads the main character could've taken i think it sucks, i'd rather see them make 24 episodes showing him slowly developing relationships with these girls and then falling for 1.  
 
The short stories alone are great but it's too hard for me to watch the same character fall in love with 6 different girls. so like I said pick a girl and watch her 4 because thats still enjoyable. 
 
The art in this was really good though as was the sound (I liked how the intro starts in english and then switches) and some of the characters were fun to watch.

    ~Will be updated weekly until the series is completed!~ 
 
This is the first review I've ever written. This anime is so amazing and unique that I just had to because for the first time ever I have found an anime that incorporates everything I have been looking for. I've seen a lot of romance anime, but none like this as it shatters many of the usual preconception's associated with the genre. 
 
This anime is set up differently than all others. It is going to be a series of 24 episodes featuring 6 different relationships. This is accomplished by dividing the series into 4 episodes a relationship then a reset which results in a complete exploration with a different girl for another 4 episodes.  
 
Now if your anything like me the art style is extremely important and sometimes the animation as well. Amagami SS does not feature any radical or unique graphics. The graphics follows along the lines of ""normal"" but done very well which is exactly the way I like it. When shows do weird and unique art styles I'm usually turned off but its safe to say you will love or be at least satisfied with the art style. The animation is also very smooth and well done. The same can be said of the sound and I didn't notice anything that would cause a distraction. 
 
Since it's almost like a new series every 4 episodes it is somewhat fast paced which is good because that is the perfect pacing. I'm not sure about other people but I absolutely hate when romance anime gets dragged on and barely any plot advances. It almost feels like filler and can be very boring. The pacing feels quite natural as well and does not feel rushed especially for something that is 4 episodes long. 
 
The characters were amazing. For once the main character isn't an annoying guy without any balls. He feels all the emotions appropriately and is very nervous but is somehow able to admit his feelings especially in situations where your thinking to yourself there's no way he'd speak up but somehow he does in a realistic and convincing way. Don't get me wrong he's very similar to all the other male lead but what makes him genuine and makes the story excellent is his ability to actually tell the girl what he's thinking despite the situation.You will literally be thinking omg this guy has balls. The cast of female characters were done well with the minor exception of Haruka as her personality and the way she interacts with the male lead doesn't seem realistic in regards to an actual relationship irl although it is very entertaining. 
 
It's one of the rare romance anime's where you see genuine character development that reflects the full picture of romance where their is a physical attraction that is mentioned and expanded. The characters actually follow a normal sense of the physical aspects of being in a relationship, which means no waiting until the last episode to see the character's kiss once. 
 
This anime is also based off of a game and as many know their are multiple paths to take which lead to different relationships. As far as I know this is the first romance anime where each and every path is explored. This is a wonderful feature as with most harem's with good character development you always wonder what the show would have been like with a different girl being the one featured.  Its very surprising because the first 4 episodes feel more complete and better than almost all romance series I have seen. So I can't wait to see how the next 5 relationships turn out. I'm quite excited as this feels like having 6 romance series in 1. 
 
Will keep you guys updated every week have fun enjoying this wonderful anime.

The story and character backgrounds are nothing too great, but they also aren't out of the realm of reality. I enjoyed the actions and events that took place between each girl and thought they were well written.  
 
Art 8/10 
 
I like the more mature looking approach to the art, instead of going to weird faces and a ""moe"" look (not sure if used right). Not much more to say about this, it was good none-the-less. 
 
Sound 7/10 
 
Nothing particularly stood out, but the soundtrack was in no way bad. The voice actors were all good and did their jobs accordingly, but, again, no one really stood out. 
 
Character 8/10 
 
First, I'll start with the main character, Junichi, he is a rare breed. A main male protagonist I actually didn't mind at all. Not saying he was anything special, which is often the case in these romance harems, but he didn't annoy me in the slightest. His personality did seem to change quite a bit depending on the arc, but that seemed unavoidable.  
 
Now, the characters that truly shine and make this anime good. All the female leads were outstanding, all of them were very unique. None of them seemed to fall back on the typical anime female characters too hard, which was refreshing, and if they did, sorry, I didn't really notice.  
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
 
This earned its place in my top romance anime list for sure. It was very enjoyable, and I'll probably end up watching it again in the future. I recommend this to all that are fans to the romance genre, in particular, the harem romance genre. 
 
Overall 8/10 
 
I don't like to go into too much detail when reviewing anime (AKA spoiling), so I apologize if this seems short. Anyways, I hope this was helpful to at least one person. 
 
Thank you, and have a great day!

    I just started watching this anime last night and I already love it.... For those of you who have seen the Clannad OVAs (other world chapters) this is kinda like that, except the different romances are drawn out over 4 episodes giving a good bit of character and relationship development. 
 
I won't give spoilers so if you want to know the reasons behind my opinions go and watch the anime. 
 
Story: 
 
The story(s) are enjoyable although I have only seen the first two arcs I think so far its been very fulfilling, it has given sufficient character and relationship development so that even though each relationship only lasts 4 episodes it gives you enough to satisfy you. The story revolves around Tachibana Junichi and Highschool junior who two years prior had been stood up by another girl on christmas eve, and his relationships with 6 different girls. 
 
Characters: I will only do the characters from the arcs I have watched as I cant tell you much about the others as you don't really know much about them. 
 
Tachibana Junichi: The first male romance anime protagonist I've actually liked a lot, he is kind good natured, but he's also reclusive and often closes himself in his closet where he has drawn stars with highlighters in their giving it a peaceful sense and makes it a place for him to relax. Typically he is perverted, and he is a bit desperate, and often does weird things with the female interest, especially in the Haruka arc, but this is explained however as he doesn't want the feeling of rejection again he will do anything to get the girl he's in love with. This may creep you out a bit, but it is one of his strong points as he is gutsy, refuses to back down and never gives up, making him more manly than most romance anime protagonists....  
 
Morishima Haruka: The first love interest in the anime and also my favorite in the story so far... She is the school idol, she's beautiful, got the perfect bod, kind but an airhead... She has never had a boyfriend as she rejects most of the people who ask her out and she can't make her mind up about what kind of guy she likes, she loves cute animals and often compares Junichi to puppies.  
 
Tanamachi Kaoru: Kaoru is one of Junichi's childhood friends, I found her to be a bit of an anime cliche... She's a Tsundere (violent but loving person) often punching and sometimes biting Junichi, there isn't much I can say about Kaoru without giving away spoilers, so you'll have to watch the anime ;) 
 
Art: Not usually one to comment on art, but the art is nice, its generally what you would expect from an anime from 2010. 
 
Enjoyment: So far I'm loving it, Good characters, good development and not pointlessly drawn out. Although the romances are short episode wise they are fulfilling and will not leave you with any questions afterwards. The anime is funny at times, a little bit creepy with some of Junichi's ""activities"" with the girls but its a good watch if you like Romance and comedy. 
 
Overall: 9/10

    SO HERE IS MY FIRST Spoiler Free Anime Review (clap) (clap) 
 
Amagami SS is a visual novel adaptation made by AIC.  
The show tells the story of one of the many paths the MC could have taken in a romance visual novel in 4 episodes. There are 6 girls and 6 arcs + 1 extra girl, each arc focuses on the relationship of our mc and one of the 6 six girls. I'll write about the 25th episode at the end of the review. Okay, enough explaining.  
 
Story: 8 
Have you ever thought that a simple thing could change your life forever. Welp that is a big thing in this show. Simply by helping a classmate, could later turn out to be your spouse later in life. This applies to real life too. Who knows, if you just confessed your love at highschool, you might be with your love of you're right now. But after saying all of that, this show has a good story for each arc. 
 
Art: 6 
The art isn't something special, I also didn't hate so I gave it a 6. Note that this show is pretty old and many anime looked like this.  
 
Sound: 7 
The soundtrack also wasn't anything special, but quite enjoyed some of the openings and endings.   
 
Character: 9 
Every character is special and unique. While watching this show I never thought to myself ""Augh i hate this girl"". After finishing this anime, I kept thinking who was best girl. Problem was every girl was great. It was tough rivalling another great girl. Our Protagonist on the other hand was a pretty generic caring romcom/harem character. The girls though, made every arc special. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 9  
I loved this show, but I am a trashy romance anime enthusiast though. I think if you love romance or harem anime you should give this a watch. And hey, who knows even if you aren't a fan of romance, you should give anything a shot. That's what this anime has taught me, who knows a little thing in life might make a huge impact later. 
 
 
Episode 25 
I hated episode 25, I think it ruins the show a little, but you should judge it for yourself. Episode 24 concludes our story nicely. I think episode 25 should have been an extra episode on the blu-ray disc.

    Its a very nice anime, with every 4 episodes another main girl with her story and future. 
The art and everything is good, nothing to complain about

    In anime where there's a love triangle, you wish that the writers made the main character (MC) end up with the other girl. You fantasize about that story line, hoping someday the writers will give the other girl some spotlight. If you do find yourself in that position, watch Amagami SS!! You will be guaranteed that every girl gets her own story. 
 
Amagami SS is in the omnibus format (a story format that I'm unfamiliar with) so the anime is divided into different arcs. So, as soon as one arc ends, the next arc begins as if the previous story never occurred. What's also cool is that you can jump around story arcs so if you start with Rihoko's arc, you can easily pick up Morishima's arc without feeling that you missed some plot lines. 
The general plot of Amagami SS is that it follows our male lead Junichi after he gets his heart broken on Christmas eve. From there, he will eventually meet 6 different girls. What makes the omnibus format awesome is that each girl gets her own story. So if you find yourself liking one of the female leads, you can directly skip to her episodes and you would not have missed a thing! 
What I found that the anime did well was that each story arc was well-tailored to the female lead's personality. For example, in Tsukasa's story arc, she is a class president and thus, the story revolves around Junichi helping with her responsibilities and through those actions, he grows closer to Tsukasa. This was definitely an area that the writers for Amagami SS did well. 
Where this anime fell was the humour. There are sexual innuendos, references, fan service, you name it, everywhere. In fact, the anime just shoves it shamelessly in your face. While it is pretty hilarious in the first few episodes that you watch, they get bland by the time you reach the last arc. But if you are into these things, you will find each episode very entertaining. 
 
The artwork was really well done. I especially liked the backdrops to each scene. They put a lot of detail into those. Also, each girl is beautifully drawn. Each of them is drawn in a unique style so you will definitely find one character who is drawn to your liking. I particularly liked Ai Nanasaki's character art because her proportions are drawn really well and her chin-length hair basically won me over. The body proportions are definitely well done for each character. 
 
The two opening versions are some of my favourite openings. I love how each one is a soft ballad, which really set me up for the romance in each episode. They are going onto the iPod very soon. Another unique thing about Amagami SS is that each character has her own ending sung by that voice actor. I thought that was pretty cool. Other than the opening and ending themes, the music in the anime was nothing spectacular but was not obtrusive in any way.  
 
Each female lead in Amagami SS represents a certain character personality. That's a very good thing because you won't get confused as to which character is which.  
Here's a quick run-down of each character in order of their appearance: 
 
Haruka Morishima - a guy's dream girl, has the best physical features. As a result, Junichi gets into a lot of awkward moments with her. I definitely enjoyed her episodes a lot.  
 
Kaoru Tanamachi - close to being ""the childhood friend"" archetype but not exactly. Junichi met her in middle school so they were friends since then. Being a headstrong character, she can be a guy's best girl-friend but she could easily friend zone you as well. 
 
Sae Nakata - the shy but cute girl (and big where it matters, if you know what I mean...). I don't particularly like this category of character so I won't go into the details of her story (this is MY opinion so if you like this kind of character, Sae probably will end up being your favourite out of the 6 girls!) 
 
Ai Nanasaki - she's close to being the Tsundere character as she starts out pretty cold but we gradually see her personality warm up. My favourite aspect of her is that she fearlessly states that Junichi is a pervert.  
 
Rihoko Sakurai - she's the ""childhood friend"" archetype. She's a bit chubby so her story is about her losing weight while finding her feelings for Junichi. 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji - the other version of a guy's dream girl. She is a ambitious leader, got the looks, but also has her flaws. 
 
In my opinion, Ayatsuji's arc is the best story. The reason being is that there is a lot of tension rising and falling between Junichi and her. I would say that she gets the best character development out of all these fine ladies. As a result, her romance story is the one you that will tug at your heart strings. 
 
There are also some supporting characters, the two main ones are Umehara, Junichi's best (and also perverted) friend, and Miya, Junichi's little sister. We don't see much character development (though Miya does get her own arc) but they are relieving to see whenever they enter the scene. 
 
As a big fan of the romance genre, I definitely felt myself enjoying Amagami SS. While I often found myself scratching my head in certain situations or just wondering how Junichi even fell for a certain girl, I rejoiced to know that I can experience another romantic story after an arc. Given that the writers only had 4 episodes to develop an entire love story, they did a really good job. Props to them! 
 
I think Amagami SS is a good starter for new anime watchers who are looking to see how romance is tackled in anime, and also for veteran romance watchers who are either looking for something short or a good general summary of all the big character types that appear in romantic stories.  
 
Amagami SS has my stamp of approval. Do check it out! 
 
Thanks for reading my review! 
 
P.S. If you were wondering, here's my ranking of the girls in Amagami SS: 
 
1. Tsukasa Ayatsuji 
2. Ai Nanasaki 
3. Haruna Morishima 
3. Kaoru Tanamachi 
5. Rihoko Sakurai 
6. Sae Nakata 
 
 
Who did you like? Let me know!

    This anime is very interesting, I mean the story arc divides between these completely  different acting  girls and one, normal guy. This anime isn't at all very perverted but it still  has those unusual/lucky moments and those always understanding guy thoughts. XD 
But what i really like about his anime is that it shows the different possiblites and oppurtunities of one guy, and that his futures turn out completely different because of them. So far the anime has not ended, but it just draws me in everytime I see a new episode.  
Very enjoyable and entertaining.

    Because it's a multiple arc-ending Anime for six heroines, there won't be any filler episodes. At the end of every arc, it immediately goes into setting up the foundation for the next heroine in the next episode. There isn't any link between arcs either; it's as if the whole story restarts from the beginning for each arc. If you can get past that, this was a very enjoyable series. Each heroine is given four episodes, so some people (myself included) may say that each heroine can be not as detailed compared to Junichi Tachibana or other main characters from another Anime series.

    I can't say I enjoyed this show like I thought I would. The designs are well done, the characters are hit-and-miss, and the themes are... I'm not really sure what the themes are. It could just be that I missed them, perhaps I wasn't looking in the right place, but I left this show feeling confused and not entirely satisfied. I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to take away from it, and while that's certainly not what should determine my feelings towards the show, it does cause it to leave a bit of a taste in my mouth that I don't know I'd come back for.  
 
The character interactions weave a tangle sand confusing web that lends itself to unfulfilled relationships and quite possibly incest, if I remember correctly. None of this really goes anywhere and it really just seems to exist to serve as padding in the episodes- that's not to say that I wasn't interested in these characters and how they interacted, but I was never really able to feel like I got something out of it.  
 
The thing I liked the most about this shows, I will say, was that its atmosphere was superb, like a dream that you really can't make heads or tails of, but one that's at least pleasant to look at for a while. It certainly had some good ideas, but I can't help but think that there were better ways to convey whatever it is that it was trying to get across. Maybe I'll feel differently about it a few years from now if I re watch it when I'm less self-absorbed and angsty. Who knows?

    RahXephon tells the story of Ayato Kamina, a student in Tokyo who dreams of being a painter. One day, Tokyo is attacked by an unknown force and Ayato is lead by his mysterious classmate Reika Mishima to the giant clay doll called the RahXephon. With the RahXephon, Ayato discovers that the world he knew is false and he is now the deciding factor in a war between two races over the fate of the Earth.  
 
My thoughts: 
This anime was addicting. I started watching and couldn't stop. It's a good thing I have all the episodes on my computer. RahXephon is a 'mecha' type anime but with a more in-depth story than Evangelion. The characters are more developed and have bite to them. There are no wishy-washy characters in Rah. The art is awesome, and the supporting cast fit perfectly. The story begins and keeps going to its end. No interruptions from filler episodes you often see with other anime.  
 
Although there is lots of action with Rah fighting the invading Golems, the story revolves around Ayato and Haruka. Because of the time dilation in Tokyo Jupiter and the outside world, Haruka aged at a normal rate, while Ayato aged more slowly, which is why he looks 17 instead of being closer to mid-twenties as he should be. 
 
RahXephon has it all, action, romance, suspense, intrigue, friendships...and the emotions come across so well. This is an anime I recommend wholeheartedly.

    Ima be honest. I am not that familiar with mecha anime because they all make my head fuzzy and I really start to get confused with shit. Like this anime confused me on who the hell was good and who the hell was actually bad. But of course as you can see from my rating, I really liked it. 
 
(May contain spoilers.....sort of?Yes contains some spoilers) 
 
Story 
---> So the story is about this guy who is just fucked up in time. Apparently Tokyo was separated with Japan or some shit like that and those in the dome, time is slowed down. So basically 1 second inside of the dome is equal to like 4 seconds outside the dome (if i did my maths right). Now to back up my statement, oh yea and before that here is kinda a spoiler but not really an important one, Ayato and Haruka's age difference is 12 years. They last met when they were 14 I think. So Ayato was trapped inside the dome until he was 16-17 and Haruka's age when he got out of the dome was 28-29. So if you subtract 29 and 17 you get 12. And if Ayato was in the dome for 3 years aging Haruka to be 29, so if you divide 12 and 3, you get 4. So one second inside the dome is four seconds outside the dome, one minute inside the dome is four minutes outside the dome, one week inside the dome is four weeks outside the dome, one month inside the dome is four months outside the dome and one year inside the dome is four year outside the dome. In this case four multiplied by three is twelve so correct me or message me if i'm wrong. Now Ayato is just a normal highschooler when he meets with Haruka whom he lost memories of. There are two kinds of people in this universe I guess. Mulians and normal humans. Mulians are basically humans with blue blood and normal humans are... well normal humans with normal blood.  
This being said, Ayato gets confused and 'follows' Haruka to fully understand why this is. Then after that everything goes skadaddle prap prup pam. After watching this anime I still don't know the origins or anything cause I wasn't really paying attention because I was waiting more on the romance and ho ho ho the fucking romance was amazing. I really want to see more romance anime where the male MC is with and older female MC. Well in this case Haruka is technically older but still the same age? Well basically a male Mc with a mature looking female. But the Male can't be a Shota. yea. oke. So you get the Idea. And the ending is fucking perfect. Well could have been better but it is real good since there aren't many anime with this kind of ending. You'll get what I mean when you finish it. So if the ending was shit i'd rate it a 7 or 6 but it didnt and i really liked it so I gave it a 10. If you don't agree with me go fuck yourself then. jk 
 
Art 
----> The art is great. You can tell the anime is produced by Bones just by the animation. Well if you've seen Eureka Seven of course (which i recommend if you have the time). Old animations honestly are much better than the new ones these days. In my opinion of course. I like how the characters looked, It wasn't bad and seemed likable to my point. 
 
Sound 
----> the voice acting is... well.... plain good I guess. It is like most anime out there so there isn't much to comment on. But I have to comment on the ending song. real fucking cool to see what they did.  At times the ending would start with 'oshiete' or 'tell me', sometimes an english language, sometimes 'kotaete' which means 'answer me'.  
It's different lyrics but the same video. Like House M.D with they're different openings. Oh yea and the opening for this anime ain't bad. (cuz i skipped every single time sorry). 
 
Overall / Enjoyment 
----> Now I know the I did not comment on character. Well, honestly it's because I am too lazy but don't tell that to anyone. I rated it 9 so i'm basically saying there weren't any people I got really irritated to. So the the anime was enjoyable, the drama was okay. Romance was fucking great. And I would recommend to you if you have nothing to watch. This is probably my longest review yet, so i've wasted some precious time. If you decide to watch this then have fun! Don't really care about details too much honestly. It's an anime. Not real life. Just go with it. heb fan

    Worth seeing all the way to the end, managing both to improve upon the Eva formula in some areas while suffering in others. 
 
What I thought it did well: 
-  Relationships between various characters were generally well done.  This is clearly a major theme of the show, and overall I liked it. 
-  It was well acted.  Even the english dub seemed solidly written and performed. 
-  The ending felt conclusive.  Even built on the Eva model, it was clear the writers knew how they wanted to end the show, and I enjoyed it. 
-  The 2nd half was a big improvement over the 1st half, being far more interesting and did better to explain what was going on.  The 1st half did not do well trying to be both mysterious and entertaining. 
-  Characters generally seemed consistent and mostly interesting.  No one was straight up crazy, and they all eventually developed into reasonably believable people. although many suffered the usual characteristics of ignorance and immaturity (common to this kind of show) at the start.  If only people could talk to each other, all of their problems could be solved! 
 
What I thought it did poorly: 
-  Its not very original.  Anyone who has seen the Evangelion series will be endlessly reminded of the similarities, not often in good ways.  Its not wrong to be similar, but RahXephon is too similar, and not usually in Eva's best attributes. 
-  The roles and organization between the Foundation, Federation, and Terra aren't believable.  In Eva they can get away with this because civilization was mostly destroyed.  In RahXephon, Tokyo is really the only serious casualty, so how these groups work together (or fail to) and their chain-of-command is utterly ridiculous.  A few tweaks to the writing could have fixed this and kept everyone in their place. 
-  Sound and music are not featured in enough quantity or quality despite claiming to be important to the story.  There is constant talk of ""world full of sound,"" music, and songs from the Mu and dolems, but there is more reference to this concept than actual application. 
-  A really boring 1st half.  I understand the desire to save the big twists and mystery reveals for the 2nd half, but that means capturing the audience in others ways leading up to it.  I considered dropping the show due to the lack of character or plot progression and general entertainment, but was determined to see it through. 
-  Boring battles.  For what is basically a mecha show, the fights were boring.  Add to that, we're given no explanation for what dolems really are, how they function, and why RahXephon is special such that it wins its battles at all (despite getting its ass kicked), making them feel pointless and lacking in any tension or excitement. 
 
Overall, it was a good watch.  I liked it, especially the 2nd half.  I enjoyed the ending.  It was an interesting idea.  It wasn't great in any areas, but if you have the free time I think its worth seeing through to the end.

    this ""bonus"" episone is kind of like a"" teaser"" to FMP:TSR it was very enjoyable to watch after not have watched FMP:TSR for awhile ,it showed a little mor in debth of how the second raid started off,which made the series a bit more exciting.BUT there were apperances of som charactors in this that made it more of a ""preview"" because their apperances were not that necessary in my oppinion,and further more the ending words ...wow they were great....it just was icing on the cake .

    Simply, you can think of this ""Episode 000"" like a trailer of ""Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid"" 
It doesn't say too much, it's something to get fans exited before ""The Second Raid"" (TSR). Also introduces you to the new characters. 
 
It's something worth to see. It's as worth as seeing a trailer. Keep in mind that only have a duration of around 5 minutes, so you don't lose anything.

    This was sooo funny XDD These two are so cute but at the same time so hilarious when they are together!  
I definetely enjoyed watching this Special. Though I am a little dissapointed by the lack of romatic scenes. The first half actually showed the two MCs together and had some cute moments but the second half was mostly funny. I wished for  more romantic scenes with these two.  
I also liked the concept/story of the first half. It kinda makes sense that he helps her out with her computer and everything seemed very realistic and relatable :P and so funny xD 
The second half was funny aswell and it was nice to see all teh characters in it. 
 
But still this episode was great and a lot of fun. I hope they make more of this.^^

    I really love this show so it would be a waste to not watch this special since I'm also quite discontented with how the series ended. I really had my hopes up with this special since it was considered as like the final episode of the franchise, but I must say, it had still left me hanging in the end.  
 
Well, the episode had two parts; the first one being the real life part which was more of a continuation of the romantic development of the two main characters, while the second part is more on the cyberworld where the real life characters interact with their game counterparts. 
 
All in all, the special was entertaining and really funny but if you're someone who wants a good ending, then you might want to stick with the series' ending and be content with it then just consider this episode as like a side story or omake.

    It was a good special episode, and I definitely enjoyed it! However, I’m glad the actual anime had the wisdom to exclude it as a separate special, and I’m probably temporarily half-scarred by what happened to Sakurai in the end for now 😂 
 
The first part of the episode was great, first of all! I’m not fond of how it started out (likeywoulditfoolmeintothinkingtheyweremovingintogetherasamarriedcouplegoddammit)(thatsnottheactualreasonimnotveryfondofhowitstartedtho), but it was great! Not only did Moriako and Sakurai became even in visiting each other’s houses, but they got to experience Fruits de Mer with each other irl, too! The hot spring bath trip idea part was hilarious, too, and aw man,, do you realize how disappointing it is for sakurai to decide to bring koisuke along, too? D: ah well its not like we were gonna watch it anyway 
 
The second part, however, is the main reason why i say it was best this episode was excluded after all. It was a bit too long, and more stupid than any of the other subplots the actual anime had :’) It was great to watch, tho, haha. It wasn’t very pleasant, tho, to see Sakurai in that clumsily ugly-ish dress + shiningly naked + very-revealing bikini (it was 99.9% c9vered, thankfully 😂), and for Koisuke to reveal his ultimate pervertedness. Again, the whole episode was enjoyable! Just,, it stands best as a special, don’t you agree~?

    Not much was added to the original anime. Honestly it just seems to be some way to prolong the show or something, but I just can't seem to find the value of this episode in general. There's a cliffhanger in the end though so maybe that means we can expect a season 2? 
 
In short, this is just a Sakurai x Morioka slice of life episode. The whole thing is basically Morioka wanting to upgrade her pc and Sakurai offering her a hand at that. So they spend the entire episode upgrading the rig and building it. Not bad in overall, but not something significant either for an OVA. 
 
What to expect: Gaming, Comedy, Blushing, Frustration, PC building tutorial. 
What to not expect: Kissing, fan service, Any overall progress in the story. 
 
That's all then. Cheers.

    I really enjoyed Net-juu no Susume Special! 
Keywords: Romance, Gamers, Slice of life, Comedy 
 
The story goes at a really slow pace, sharing the thoughts of an introverted gamer. The main protagonist can be really depressing in the way she downgrades herself when she is a capable woman. It's interesting that most of the characters are adults who find joy in playing MMOG. The interaction btw characters are mature. here's some heart aching moments both during good/bad moments.  
 
PROS 
+ The comically awkward interaction btw the male and female lead (Sakurai & Morioka) 
+ Complicated relationships btw real life and virtual characters 
+ Smooth transition btw real and virtual world, making it easy to follow 
+ Best couple supporter (Koiwai) 
+ Nice approach on some sensitive topic of online gaming 
 
CONS 
- Complicated relationships btw real life and virtual characters 
- Not enough depth of each character's intro/backstory, especially the main protagonist 
- The ending makes you crave for more episodes  
 
Search for Net-juu no Susume if you crave for more. 
 
[SPOILER ALERT] 
I'm glad that there's no love triangle in this story, only two awkward yet cute adult's blooming love. It'll make you feel like cheering for them. I'm looking forward to the hot spring trip!

    Okay, going to write a short review for a change, I've already reviewed the anime itself after all and this is just an OVA.  
 
This OVA is actually better than the main anime, the jokes are more amusing and their interactions are pretty nice. It doesn't have many laughs in store, but it does have quite a few smiles, far more so than the main anime.  
 
Maybe it's because the story was completely different than the main one that it managed to be a fair bit more interesting and entertaining. Now it's more of a romcom than a slow romance story. We can watch them as they develop their relationship for real and aren't just walking in circles around eachother while thinking too much as they talk and talk and talk about absolutely uninteresting crap. Ridiculously enough, this episode, this OVA filler, felt more realistic(well, at least the first half was realistic) and immersive than any of the 10 main episodes.  
 
Well, the bad thing is probably that this just isn't good enough for more than one or two episodes, after that it'd turn boring. Still, it was a good episode and a great closure to the anime, instead of leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth from the main anime, I managed to rinse my mouth with this OVA, making me remember this anime in a slightly fonder light. If the other 10 episodes had a similar mood and flow to this OVA, it would've been a way better anime overall.

    Well, since this special is an extension of the mother anime, it's safe to say that my ratings form my review of the parent anime's special the most part won't change like the Story, Sound, Character and Enjoyment, but it's a different thing for the Art and Overall. so let's get over with it: 
  
 
Story: 
 
It hasn't change when it come to the plot from its parent anime, since this anime continues where the couple has left in episode 10, here this the getting to know phase. 
 
Sound:  
 
We still have them seiyuu portraying the characters voices, like Noto Mamiko in her natural voice as well as the other like Sakurai Takahiro who is playing the male lead, since this anime calls for it. 
 
Character:  
 
well, we still have the usual gang whether in the game or in the real world. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
Well, it;s nice to know that we've seen some progression.......for the 1st part that is, regardless, my rating would still be the same as the parent anime.  
 
Now, here's the thing: 
 
fair 6, Art: 
 
Cu'z we now see some Morika fanservice thought briefly only, like her in her topless for with only her panty, don't expect any frontal boobies and her in a bikini armor, but only in a dream sequence, thought it would have been better if she would have wore it a little bit longer. 
 
fair 6, Overall: 
 
From my rating of 9 in the parent anime I've reduced it to 6, since the special didn't live up to it's episode title ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"" cu'z here Mori Mori only had a half ass of a recovery, she is still a NEET, and we see her preferring to live in the MMO world with her avatar friends and girlfriend, also the awkwardness that still exist between Mori Mori and Sakura never progress beyond the real world and still Mori Mori prefer to be an introverted NEET, it's like nearly being there only to back out on the last minute , that's how I see it, so another special????????KAAAAAAAAAK PTUI!!!!!!! That's me spitting on this special. 
 
 
Gaston OUT!!!!!

    This was a very fun watch to top off the original series. It's an OVA, so you shouldn't expect any sort of character development, but it brings in all the characters we loved into a fun setting. Its style is just like the main series, but it does a little trip down memory road with some references to the past events that occur in the main series. If you enjoyed the original TV series, this will be a nice watch. The character dynamics are the same as always, but it's just like revisiting an old friend and finding that they haven't changed.

    Net-juu Susume was one of the greatest anime this season, and here it is, the much awaited special of it. Honestly speaking it wasn't so good as I expected it to be, but it wasn't bad either. I'll refrain from spoilers in this review. 
 
The story is the weakest point of the special. The episode is divided into two parts. The first part is wonderfully cute, and I am a sucker for cute romances, and I straight away rated it 10. There are a few cliche shojo scenes and I went kyaaah in he first half. But then there's the second part too, which is a bit boring. Thus the 7/10 score. 
 
Art is as usual. Morioka-san is darn cute and so is Lily-san. That's a plus.  
 
Sound is terrific. The special uses the original OP and ED of the anime, and they are really good. 
 
Nothing much to say about the character. Sakurai is great as the shy boyfriend, and Morioka, is just goddamn cute. I'd give anything to get her in real life. 
 
Overall I'll rate this special 8. Why? Because it's damn good. Most of the anime specials are just extra episodes but this one is actually a sequel. You get more of the cute romance of the couple and some pretty doki doki going shojo moments in the first half. I'd have given it a 9 if not for the second half. It just seems like an afterthought and my hopes further got dashed when the bikini costume wasn't used(insert evil grin). 
 
So, should you watch it? Absolutely YES. Net-juu no Susume has proved to be the sleeper hit this season and you should watch it and then see this special.

    OMG I loved this OVA. 
 
It was only one episode length but It left me smiling from ear to ear throughout the entire episode with its cute comedy between Morioka and Sakurai. 
 
As usual for this anime the art looks amazing and seeing best girls Lily and Morioka again for sadly the last time was a great treat. 
 
Also getting to hear that amazing OP and ED again was great. 
 
This OVA was better than most full series comedies I've watched. 
 
If you've seen and liked the series you'll love this and if you haven't go watch them if you like comedy romances.

    This isn't even going to be a review, this is going to be a fucking rant.  
 
This 6 short few minutes OVA seriously just shows the potential of how awesome and amazing Naruto could have been. Not the crap shit it is right now with all the fillers memories talking etc.... JUST LOOK AT THIS!!! 
 
The fight scenes look INTENSE, there's no constant TALKING, no NEEDLESS FILLERS, no MEANINGLESS FLASHBACKS FOR 5 HOURS,  
 
Just straight, high end, kick ass fighting. AHHHHHH, 
 
It's just so frustrating cus this, THIS, THIS 6 MINUTE OVA, IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE POTENTIAL NARUTO COULDA BEEN, BUT NOOOO YOU JUST GOTTA RUIN IT BY FUCKING ADDING 5 BILLION HOURS WORTH OF FILLERS TO CASH DRY THE SHIT OUT OF THAT SHOW, 
 
FUCK 
 
... 
 
Told you this was just gonna be a rant :/

    High school student Sora Kashiwagi is apprehensive due to previous bad experiences with his father's ""gifts"" when he receives a mysterious oversized package by his self-proclaimed ""adventurer"" father. With his imagination going wild, the last thing Sora expects is for it to be opened from the inside... by a little mummy so small it can fit in the palm of his hand! 
 
My Thoughts: 
Also called How To Keep a Mummy, this anime is funny, lighthearted and endearing.  Mii-kun is such a lovable little mummy.  I love the way the 'oni"" can communicate without having to actually speak with words.  Gestures and sound like grunts seems to get their point across.  Sora's character is caring and selfless.  He does whatever he can to help in any way when someone needs it.  I love the camaraderie between Sora and his friends.  This anime was a fun watch and I hope they do a season 2.

    Yes, this anime is cute, but it’s more than that. I know being cute is enough to pull people in by itself, but I’ll try to convey how pleasantly surprised I was when I started watching this small show that almost nobody is talking about. 
 
 
Story: 
Miira no Kaikata is best described as a Slice-of-Life, although the circumstances aren’t very close to normal life, at least at first. Kashiwagi Sora, our protagonist, gets sent a miniature mummy in the mail by his father, and after some thought, decides to care for it. And the anime is just this concept, although expanding by adding more characters, both human and not.  
 
Most of the so-called “arcs” of this anime aren’t that substantial. Though, maybe it’s expected considering the primary genre is Slice-of-Life. The cast goes through a few basic situations and gags, and whilst the story likes to get serious from time to time, it’s never too dramatic, and it mostly leads things to return to the status quo, plus some character development. If you’re looking for shows with strong and complex stories, then don’t watch this. It’ll only disappoint you. 
 
One aspect about the storytelling I want to highlight is how the supernatural pets are parallels to children, and the owners parallel parents. I know, drawing a connection between pets and children isn’t very difficult, considering how some people think these two might as well be the same thing. However, the way the anime showcases Mii-kun’s (The mummy’s) cute bumbling and curiosity, how among all the pets, they all gained different roles, and how it almost feels like the humans are competing on who has the best child, this coming up when one of them learns how to write. There are other examples, but I won’t get into them too much here. 
 
 
Characters: 
As expected of a lighthearted show, Miira no Kaikata has a very pleasant cast that rarely fight and relish in pleasantries. I swear, too much of this show’s dialogue is pleasantries… Anyways, where was I?  
 
The human characters, being the previously mentioned MC Kashiwagi, his best friend Kamiya, their classmate Motegi, and finally another student, Takechi, are all decent characters, although nothing special. However, one aspect I enjoy how each of these four gaining a supernatural animal as a pet helps them get through a personal problem, whether it’d be Kamiya inability to show affection, Motegi’s irrational fear of lizards, or Takechi’s constant nightmares. How these characters get over these hang-ups, I won’t spoil.  
 
On the other hand, the pets are just adorable. They have their own moments of character, of course, and their bonds with their owners feel surprisingly genuine. Mii-kun is probably the most adorable thing I’ve ever witnessed in anime, and it’s the biggest highlight of the show in cuteness. The child-demon Conny and dragon Isao are both cute as well. Mukumuku, the sleep-eating Baku, I would’ve liked to see more of, since all it did throughout the show was teleport around, pretty much. Still though, the pets are the core of the show, so if you don’t like cute animals (IF you don’t, what’s wrong with you?), then this anime certainly won’t please you. 
 
 
Animation and Sound: 
If I had to pick out the biggest weakness of Miira no Kaikata, it’d be the animation. Whilst every scene with the pets is made with delicate details to make it extra-adorable, I can’t say the same for everything else. It’s passable, but there won’t be any moments where you’re mind-blown by the animation.  
 
Sound, on the other hand, has me conflicted. In terms of voice acting, the humans don’t have anything great going on. Again, it’s passable. However, once again the pets come in to save the day, as their signature small noises do what they need to do. They’re frickin’ adorable, of course. Especially Mii-kun’s voice. I can’t get enough of it. 
 
The same level of confliction happens when discussing music. The background music is very basic and uninteresting, couldn’t remember a single track if my life depended on it. The opening and ending, though, both have great songs. Oh, and the animation accompanying both of these are the same quality as everywhere else, but still, once again, does its job by being cute. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
If you couldn’t tell, I loved this anime for its pleasant atmosphere. Although, I have to say that the big thing that separates Miira no Kaikata from other “just cute” shows is that it doesn’t feel like it is just cute. All the cuteness in the show isn’t shoved in your face as it would be elsewhere. That, and this anime was clever by having the sound effects of the pets add to the whole experience.  
 
 
Conclusion: 
As a whole, if I had to describe this anime in only a couple of words, it’d be “Big-hearted”. The characters are enjoyable, the interactions between the owners and pets are heartwarming, the gags and the adorable bumbling are beyond enjoyable, and nothing that I’ve really seen to this capacity anywhere else. And again, the cuteness isn’t shoved in your face. 
 
Does the anime have problems? Of course. The story is inconsequential, the writing can get pretty damn generic, and the production values are not noteworthy. But goddamn it, this show gives so much with so little. The heart of this anime is so big that I can’t even describe it. I was just in a great mood whenever I was watching it.  
 
I definitely recommend this to anyone who’s a fan of Slice-of-Life or cute animals. If you love both, then nothing can go wrong, really. For the rest of you, I’d say to at least check it out, but be wary of the fact that I may just love it too much for personal reasons. But really, more people need to know this anime’s existence. It’s a bundle of adorableness that this medium is known to be great at, and it deserves more love. 
 
Final score: 8

    SO 
This anime was probably one of those that had less hype going on, which is kinda sad to be honest..... It was definitely in my Top 3 this season and i loved it! I've seen a lot of people saying that it was adorable and stuff, but for me it had a rather heart-warming effect. It brought a warmth to my heart every damn episode, which i loved too. 
 
Story: 9 
Filled with adorable creatures, that aren't really noticed by people in the modern world/society, with most based off Japanese culture; gods, yokai, kemono etc. (i dont really know how many are there) + those like the mummy from egypt and dragon from idk what mythology, 'cuz there's bound to be one at least in one and every (almost). Centering around 4 main characters with their 'monster' and how they got to meet them as well as developing everyone's personality and showing them themselves in seperate episodes and all of this in 12 episodes is for me a rare occurrence. I really enjoyed this and still can't believe such a good show just ended TnT 
 
 
Art: 8 
Both art and animation was beautiful. I likes how their eyes where blured uner their hair and even though the art-style wasn't that special, it was pleasant to my eye. I enjoyed the way animators portrayed Mii-kun's emotions and how lovely he was drawn (except a few shots TuT). Overall i think it was done well :') 
 
Sound: 7 
I REALLY enjoyed both OP and ED, which i even now watched just for the sake of staying in this great mood the anime has set for me <3 OST was okay and the voice actors were great choices too :'3 
 
Character: 8 
Not much to say here. They were all awesome. I liked the idea of the 'monsters' staying at some of the MCs' houses because they either couldn't survive otherwise or the fact that MCs needed help. There was variety of characters to get to know and they all had different personalities, different backstories and their own troubles. I couldn't get enought of either and aaaaa this anime is just so nice  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
if i still haven't convinced you to go and watch this god-damned good anime then idk how anymore x'D I loved the series and its plot. Really, if you have free time, go watch it :'D 
 
Overall: 9 
I wish there were more cute-fun-hidden meaning anime that just let's you be sucked into its world 'cuz i don't know what to compare it to anymore..... I saw a few peeps comparing it to Gakouen Babysitter or whatever its called but honestly...... It wasn't it for me..... This show is a great one, it's a lot of fun and i couldn't wait every week for new episode to get released...... wish it came out on Netflix instead of the crap Sword Gai pulled...... Go read manga if you can 'cuz the anime isn't THAT great... But. This isn't a review about that, it's about the good show. Miir no Kaikata will stay as one of my favourites, especially in EDs. 
 
Well... Gotta go draw a few 'lil monsters ;'D

    How to Keep a Mummy is a pleasant surprise that captures your heart with adorableness as a mostly slice of life meets supernatural pets.  
 
Overall I find the story pleasant because of the genre, so each episode is kind of a day to day life scenario. There are some moments that end up a little wacky and sudden because there are some serious moments that show up and near the end characters suddenly receive a bunch of quirky traits to progress the plot. And you can definitely feel emotional from them because you grow quite attached to everyone. But I can kind of roll with it because that's the feeling of the show.  
 
Despite some quality issues as we all can recognize at times, this art style and color palette are very effective at communicating cute adorable motions. And for Mii a lot of effort goes in and shows with his cute sound effects. Sound effects are the biggest detail that really works well for the whole production!  
 
I wasn't particularly impressed with the whole cast as they are a mash of many tropes but I don't dislike any of them either. Sora and Tazuki's friendship is a point of interest that is a driving force compared to anyone else, and at times really makes you wonder more.  
 
Definitely in the end, this anime is like a hidden gem for many who just want a relaxing series or some cheering up.

    How to Keep a Mummy is a hard anime to rate because, when you think hard enough about the show, not much happens during its 12 episode run. The show's main pull is just how adorable Mii-kun and the rest of the fantasy creatures that appear in the series are doing totally mundane things. The only plot the show has is a handful of mystery-themed episodes where the main cast stumbles upon some element of Japanese mythology with its cuteness factor dialed up to 11. 
 
That said, while you could argue that the story doesn't have much going for it, the show is a constant onslaught of cuteness and it knows it. How to Keep a Mummy ends up feeling like the supernatural equivalent of watching a ton of baby animal videos - nobody is watching this show for the sake of the plot. My friend Ali and I watched this together and pretty much spent the entire run of the anime cooing and squealing like it was the first day with a newly adopted puppy. 
 
You'll be able to tell if How to Keep a Mummy is for you from the first ten minutes. If you think Mii-kun is adorable and enjoy his adorable antics, you'll like the show. If you don't, you won't, and also you have no soul.  
 
Seriously, look at how cute this mummy is!

    Hey folks, this will be a review for Miira no Kaikata. Have you ever heard someone say something was so sweet that it gave them diabetes? Well this show might actually be sweet enough to do that. 
 
The story revolves around a group of kids from high school who have this ability to see special creatures. Each character has their own creature that they take care of and they spend their days living their lives with them. 
 
The art was fitting and the soundtrack and VA was great.  
 
The characters are a great part of the show. Each one has their own personality but they have a good group dynamic and don't feel like they are overshadowed by another. To add on to that, they each are joined by a creature which has their own personality.  
 
However with all that being said this show isn't about the story, the characters, or anything else really. Its just to enjoy. The show is remarkably cute. I've never been a huge fan of shows that straight up aim for the ""aww effect"" but this one seems well done. The creatures feel real and don't feel like mascots thrown at you to sell something. The show is slow paced and is gentle to watch, but doesn't become boring or tedious. They try to spice up the ending side of the show which was unnecessary. The world building also has some questionable elements, but again it doesn't matter. 
 
If you like shows with plots, or some manner of reasoning to their actions this isn't for you. However if you want something to relax and let yourself go into this is a great show.

    I'll start saying that Miira no Kaikata (translated to ""How to Keep a Mummy"") was easily the biggest surprise of the winter season. 
 
It follows Sora, a high school student who is always gifted with weird supernatural stuff (that usually hurts or curses him) from his father. Nonetheless, one day, he is sent a tiny mummy, whom he starts raising both as a pet and a son.  
 
This mummy is the main reason I absolutely loved this anime. It doesn't talk, it thinks like a 4-year old... But it's one of the most cute and funny creatures that had appeared in an anime. It's hard not to smile while watching Mii-kun's reactions to the world.  
 
As the anime keeps going, new characters are introduced, as well as new creatures. And everyone gets along so well, in a way that you don't feel any forced humor, feelings, or cuteness. The key here is naturality, since everything flows perfectly fine. 
 
There is not much to talk about the story since it's a simple SoL. Some flashbacks about the protagonists are shown to explain short problems that appear during the episodes.  
 
The art and sound are not memorable (Except for the creatures' design), but far from bad. It fits with the simplicity this series aimed to. 
 
Overall, it can be described with one word: Simple. And that same simplicity allows you to feel what the characters feel and cheer for every little adversity Mii-kun and the others try to get over, be it missing someone, or trying to make sushi.

    To be honest, after reading the summary of this show, I was eager to watch it. The first few episodes were quite alright, simple slice of life with a dash of supernatural cuteness. Standard stuff. But as more episodes followed... I recognized this main problem with this series - the lack of direction. The premise is good, this idea that there are some supernatural beings surrounding us at every corner, wherever we go, but just because we're not aware of their existence, we don't notice them. A bit similar to how muggles don't notice wizards and witches because they don't know about magic. I'll try not to spoil too much saying this... But the logic is lost quite quickly and the moral compass of the main protagonists is off the rails soon after as well. After finishing the last episode I was left with a lot of unanswered questions which gave way to even more questions. To be frank, I wish there were more episodes to this anime. I haven't read the manga yet, but if even the manga lacks all of the answers then I think the main problem is the story/writing itself. And that's not good. I like the cute mascot that Mii-kun is, but my ""adult brain"" just can't handle the lack of logic this anime is presenting. I really hope it's just because this is directed to a younger audience and not because the author of the source material is not the best of story writers.

    Miira no Kaikata starts off very questionably I'd say. After making his aunt a nightly snack, our main protagonist, the laundry boy Kashiwagi receives a package and thrown off by the fact that all the packages from his dad were and most likely will be scary to the point where he'll be questioning whether or not to open them, he decides to just stay still while the most adorable thing walks out of it - 
Mii-kun! 
 
From then on the anime is very wholesome and continues to be like it for the rest of the series. It has some very 'moe' moments and it's great.  
 
 
Story; 8/10 
 
Nothing is really going on in the first few episodes, MC and his childhood friend get their partners, MC accepts Mii-kun with open arms but the other one is a bit reluctant about it. They meet some friends and whatnot, they meet up and hang out. Overall the story isn't that much important, the real matter of importance is the humor and the glorious cute moments this show has. It's also fast-paced which is a plus for me. 
 
Characters; 8/10 
 
Not much is explored but the friendship between our MC and his childhood friend Tazuki deepens throughout various episodes. The other two, Asa and Taichi are there just because, but it's okay because the anime makes up for it, in a way that makes you look at them in a whole different light. It includes them in various moments that would've been impossible to achieve without them. The side characters receive a bit of development too. So overall, some of the characters develop, some don't, it's average, but considering this wasn't the main point of the show, I enjoyed it a lot. 
 
Art; 9/10 
 
I can't possibly explain how much I love this art style in anime. It makes the characters look cute and possibly more friendly then they could be. Transitions between images looked smooth as well. 
 
Sound; 7/10 
 
I didn't really notice the sound as much as, let's say the OP. The opening of the series is great, upbeat just like some of the episodes and fits the series completely. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall; 9/10 
 
I really liked this show as I said before, although it's a shame that it didn't receive any popularity ever since it began. Moe shows like this should be celebrated in my opinion. If you like cute, wholesome anime then I recommend you watch it.

    The story seemed very simple in the beginning. A young boy receives a Mummy from his traveling father and he tried to understand him. However the more we progress through the series the more knowledge we gain about what kind of world they live in. Where some people are aware of the existence of super natural beings (Mummy's, Oni's, Dragons, Gods, etc) and some people are not aware. Add in the relationship building between these creatures and their human partners we learn about each characters backstory, both the good and the bad  
finally there are some ominous moments throughout this anime which made me question ""Is this show going to take a serious turn?"" That is something I will keep...Under WRAPS! (get it?) 
 
The art and animation wasn't anything too grand. However the coloring in Kaede's hair was superb.  
 
I really enjoyed everything sound wise in this anime. The opening and ending were really fun and the bgm throughout the show was fantastic. However the noises the Creatures made were amazingly good! Especially Mii-Kun's ""Woofs"" Super adorable! 
 
The characters were very interesting. Each seemed to have some kind of advanced skill which was never really mentioned throughout the series. Their backstories were really eye opening and inspirational as well. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It had a great balance of Funny, Serious, Cute and Sad moments. A very well balanced anime I feel can make it way better. 
 
Overall I think this anime is not for everyone. I feel as though some people would consider it slow, or that the story is not there, or that it is overly cute. However I think this show should be watched at least once by every anime fan.

    I started watching this anime for how cute and sweet it looked and I wasn't disappointed but I certainly stayed for the characters and story especially towards the end. The first few episodes are definitely what I expected going into it. They were simple, one-off style episodes that makes the anime feel like you could stop and pick it back up at any time but by episode 6 I found myself more invested in the characters and their stories. Each of the pets have a certain personality and relationship with their owners. Tazuki and Sora have a backstory that keeps you interested and the hints that are left for some of the later plot points makes you want to finish it.  
 
Story: 7/10 
I enjoyed the way a major plot was sprinkled in throughout the show but I felt like that left it for a lot of loose ends. There are too many questions left open for my liking which might be answered in the manga but I haven't read it yet. Parts of the story ended up feeling rushed towards the end because it started off with one-off stories. While I enjoyed it, the series left me with more questions than it answered. 
 
Art: 6/10 
This show excelled in having these cute mythical creatures have personality through their look. Even the way they moved you could tell their personalities. I also think it did a good job using visuals to convey what they were feeling since the 4 main creatures didn't talk. Where the show fell short was with its human characters. They seemed a bit stiff and at some points, they were too simple for my liking 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The soundtrack kept the mood of the show flowing but honestly, I didn't notice it too much.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
The thing this show did the best was keeping you interested in the characters. Not only was each character loveable but they were expanded on. They got some sort of backstory as well as development. Even the creatures ended up having personalities even without speech. The relationships also shined both between the humans and their pets but also between all the creatures and all the humans. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
This show is made to make you smile. You can sit back and enjoy this show easily. Its fun and sweet and even if you aren't too interested in the story you can find enjoyment through the cute interactions and sweet personalities of the characters.

    To begin this review I want to point out that this show show be watched purely for the sake of enjoyment. No real over-analyzing or absurd theories, just watch it and enjoy. 
 
Story - 8: I wanted to give the story a 10 because of how much I thoroughly enjoyed the show, but here's the thing, this show has no real story in terms of beginning, middle, end, so I gave it an 8. The story is that Sora was sent a living mummy child (Mii) by his father who is a self-proclaimed adventurer and the series follows around their life together as Sora raises Mii and learns more about him while the people who become closest to him also get their own fantasy creature companions (an Oni child, a dragon, and a baku) and shenanigans ensue. The true enjoyment of this show comes from just how adorable every creature (and even the people) are and how you just want to hug hold, play with and adopt every one of them. So despite the lack of a true story, this is a show that I could watch endless seasons of because I just want to see this gang of misfits. 
 
Art - 10: Very straightforward, the art is clean and crisp, the colors are vivid, and the animation is solid (so solid that I chose this show to be my test subject for learning to make gifs in Photoshop). 
 
Character - 10: If I haven't said this in any of my other reviews, I NEED character development. While I won't count conquering a fear of lizards or finally getting a good night's rest as character development, the real development lies within the two main human characters (Sora and Tazuki) and their creatures (Mii and Conny). While even their character development may not be considered the most complex of all time, it does happen in a very appropriate way: all of the characters begin as very well-rounded people, but who they are as people is slowly unraveled to you and as you learn more about what makes them rough around the edges, they learn how to move beyond those traits. 
 
Enjoyment - 10: This is the real meat of this review. This show is disgustingly cute and I loved every minute of it. Mii literally doesn't talk, he just barks and cries and I want one (why only one? because I wouldn't want any others thinking they weren't getting attention). Whenever Mii cries, I cry (which is every episode) and it just makes me want to hug him, thankfully Sora is an angel and will take care of him to his dying breath. Conny is a brat and goes perfectly with the too-cool-for-school Tazuki. Isao is a good boy and a perfect big brother to all of the creatures and is even more responsible than his precious human counterpart, Motegi. and just overall the cast is lovable. 
 
Overall - 10: TL;DR SOMEONE GIVETHAT MUMMY A HUG. For a show with no overall story other than the life of these humans and their mythical pets, I don't think I've been this attached to a show in a while (That's a lie because BNHA exists) and am so ready and willing to throw my money out the window just to get a life-sized Mii plushie.

    It's about a little mummy that is super cute and his adventures. The story is relaxing and constantly brings a smile to your face or a laugh at certain moments. It's kinda slow but is just barely enough to keep up your interest in it. 
 
In each of the episodes the protagonist makes new friends and their guardians discover new things. Fantasy creatures are abound which makes for a good watch specially for kids. There is an underlying threat that is constantly looming above them which is revealed towards the last few episodes. Other hidden themes are of losing someone, understanding relationships and the cruelty of humans towards animals or creatures. 
 
Overall, a nice anime to watch if you want something slow paced and hilariously cute!

    In short, this anime is very thin even for a SoL anime. That thin characteristic can be felt almost in all aspects, but for the story and characterization aspects will get better in the latter part of this anime. This anime, for sure, has its own strong point to please the viewers : pets that are cute. This is the breakdown for the review : 
 
Story 3/10 
 
The story part is very simplistic. As SoL anime, usually simplistic story gives relaxing feels to the viewer. But at the earlier part, this anime’s story is overly simplistic and can be said as “narrow” and “shallow”.  And those characteristics can’t be used as an execuse even for SoL anime. Fortunately this will get better in the half-end of the story as it’ll get deeper about some other themes, such as “relation” and “maturation”. 
 
This anime has supernatural genre attached to it, but mostly, it’s only attached to it. There are too few supernatural part in this anime, save for a very few episodes that have story around supernatural environment. Oh, and the pets themselves. They are supernatural beings but don’t feel like one. 
 
Art 5/10 
 
The chara design for this anime is that of average, except for the pets which is cute. Really, the pets design are cute and simple, which makes it possible to be animated fluidly. For the human characters, the most noticable part of the chara design is their hair. Those hair styles and colours are what you expect to find in many average shounen animanga.  
 
Even though the design is that of a shounen, it’s character animation (which i define as “movement”) is nothing shounen-ic at all. It’s more of a shoujo-ic movement actually, as we can see from the male characters gesture. This is more appearent in the ED song which all of the big characaters dance like a girl-band. This discrepancy between character design and the style of movement gives feel that either of those two fit with the anime as a whole. 
 
There are many different backgrounds for sure, but not that many. Most of them are just simply a wall or very common buildings. This kind of background doesnt give anything into the viewers’ eyes, except “oh, there’s a background”. That, combined with the lack of fluid animation from the human characters gives feels that there is almost nothing notable about this anime’s art. Except for the pets, that is. 
 
Sounds 4/10 
 
First, it’s about the seiyuus.....and there’s not much to talk about except, it’s done rather decently. The seiyuus gave a voice that quite befitting each character in this anime, but nothing is particularly good. We can only tell that “this character might sound like this”, but we cannot tell what kind of person this character is just by hearing its voice.  
 
The BGM also doesnt sound particularly good. It just there, but very likely viewers won’t take notice of it. The OP song is that your average anime’s opening. The ED, however, is quite well done...for the animation part. The songs and music are just there, but not giving any amplification for the anime as a whole. 
 
Long to short, for the sound aspect, here’s a statement that i feel can represent it : quite lively outside, quite lifeless inside. 
 
Character 5/10 
 
The characterization in this anime isn’t that strong. It affects the story but for a moment. Some may say that the characterization is very simple, altough others may say it’s very predictable and boring. I saw that both of them were true, but the latter one overshadows the first. 
There is character development in this anime. It’s not dramatic development, but this is SoL anime and that kind of development is kind of norm for this genre. For the earlier part of the anime, the character development can’t be felt except very faintly. But it gets better in the latter part. 
 
Enjoyment 6/10 
 
The main strong point that this anime has....is the enjoyment. This enjoyment mainly can be gotten from watching the pets. They act very cutely. Add their simplistic design and moderate fluidity, the viewers will want more and more to see these pets.  
Light comedy is also that makes this anime enjoyable. Note that the comedy itself is pretty classic for anime’s joke. For some people, this kind of joke may feel bland. But nevertheless, this anime has comedy. The comedy exist and some of them may make the viewers smile despite feeling bland for the most part. 
 
Overall 4,6 to 5 /10  
 
Overall, this anime is very thin, narrow and shallow – even for SoL anime. It gets better with the latter part, around the second half of the 12 episodes, but there’s still almost nothing in this anime. Except for pets. The cuteness of the pets is what makes this anime may worth to watch. Maybe. Try it yourself and decide whether it suits your taste or not :)

The main protagonist, Sora, always receives dangerous things from his father in Egypt, but this time, it's the opposite? I might be biased, because this anime is so adorable, so you might wanna keep the ambulance on dial. It's a new concept and I don't think I've heard of any anime like this.  
 
Art: 7/10 
I guess everything is adorable, even the things you should find scary is suddenly cute. 
 
Character: 8/10 
Unique and adorable characters. But of course, the main character is always that person who is so selfless and does everything by himself. Sora is adorable and so kind but it annoys me.  
 
Enjoyment/Overall: 8/10 
How many times have I said cute or adorable? It's too, too adorable, I can't handle it, haha. It's definitely an anime you should. Especially if you want to relax or need healing after life gives you a punch.

    There's honestly nothing extremely remarkable about this, yet it's pretty good. If you're here after watching Gakuen Babysitters (believe me, I was in the same boat) then stick around for this.  
 
To begin with, the story is nothing special. It's about a boy in a world with magical creatures and him and his friends have them as pets. That's literally it. There's tons of plot holes and unexplained phenomena and strange shit going on, but I tried by best to ignore all of that because of the sole reason that it's cute enough at times for me to enjoy that instead of complain. But sadly, since plot kinda matters to me most of the time (unless the other elements are that overpowering) I kept thinking about the problems the story had instead of enjoying it. Perhaps that's a mistake on my own part.  
 
The art is pretty simple, nothing special. In episode 8, there are a few creatures that are animated very well and the art is pretty cool, but other than that, everything is pretty flat and simple.  
 
The opening and closing are both wholesome, but far too happy and cutesy for me to like them all that much. The voicing for the characters was alright, but I mostly really loved the sound effects and the noises from Mii and the other cute pets.  
 
Overall, for character, there was nothing all that remarkable. I can barely remember the name of the main characters, and I just binged it before writing this review. I have to say that I like Tazuki tho... he's just my type :D Unfortunately, there's not really any character development for anybody but him-- not that I was expecting a mummy to have character development.  
 
Now down to the general opinion about the show. All in all, I watched this for two reasons: 1) because I am a hardcore fan of Gakuen Babysitters, and 2) because I adore mummies... they simply just fascinate me. However, for people who are here for any of these two reasons, I have to tell you this: if you're here because you liked Gakuen Babysitters, there's still a chance you may dislike this. What sets Gakuen apart is the fact that it's about family connections and babies growing up, simply put. With Miira no Kaikata, the part of the show that was focused on togetherness and cuteness changes focus to mythical creatures predominantly. While there were some cute moments, I really didn't have as much of a reaction as I did to Gakuen.... it just wasn't cute enough for me. Perhaps it's because I'm not an animal person? I'm definitely a baby person. As for everyone who's here for liking mummies: honestly, just get out. It's got nothing to do with legitimate mummies. Enough said.  
 
I would recommend this if you: are an animal person, like shows about mythical creatures, like shows about pets 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: are expecting as much cuteness as Gakuen Babysitters, don't like animals, can't stand plot holes 
 
Have a great day everyone!

    SoL-genre themed anime are the hottest trend in Winter 2018, and Miira no Kaikata is no exception: a sight of humans with critters as their individual and respective companions that fit well with them. 
 
What happens when your parents send you something from overseas that's an oddity? Well, prepare your hearts for Mii-kun the mummy that's cute and adorable as well as the other critters! 
 
The show does what is done best: cuteness overload bearing to the point that it's nice and smiles around to see the critters (Conny, Isao, Mukumuku) relating to Mii-kun, and not forgetting their owners too. 
 
It begins with Sora Kashiwagi, with his ""adventurer"" tag of a father, sending him the mummy case, and as usual the oversized case hides the small adorable Mii-kun, which Sora got used to amidst the ""instruction manual"" that's attached to it. 
 
Then in comes Sora's best buddy, Tazuki Kamiya, with Conny, an oni child that's seems to be jealous and frustrated at its owner's actions, with Tazuki realizing Conny's plea and eventually comes to accept him wholeheartedly. 
 
One of their classmates, Asa Motegi, encounters Isao, a flying dragon (NOT lizard, which is her absolute fear) that like Mii-kun is able to understand what his owner is saying, but the dragon critter is probably the most shy one out of the rest for its inadequacy to react fast (e.g. *SPOILER ALERT* when Asa and Isao first met in her room). 
 
The weird person of the group, Daichi Tachiaki, a senior schoolmate, knocked out by the numerous bad dreams in his life during his sleep, Mukumuku is here to the rescue to suck up his negative energy despite its boisterous size. He's also the most uncanny person of the group, but does help occasionally for the group. 
 
And what better way to explain the whole synopsis with the great art and animation by 8-bit? Haven't seen such prowess at the studio for years gone by, but this really solidifies the studio as one of the greats when it comes to the SoL genre, so seeing this pop up with bright colours made to entice kids and people who love cute things definitely made our days. 
 
The sound too evokes cuteness, yet nice and good-hearing tunes to listen to. I will admit the sound department in this show isn't the strongest, but both the OP and ED really gave the show it's appeal IMO, so much so that it's a good hear, just not a great one by any means. 
 
Overall, I really felt that I enjoyed this hidden gem of a show that not many people are wiling to take a shot to try out. Heck, now that the anime's finished, I recommend you peeps to try it out and be pleasantly surprised by it, just no expectations please!

    The season passed and this anime sadly got no hype whatsoever at any point, but damn I would be lying if I said I didn't love it! The easiest way to describe Miira no Kaikata is “diabetes bomb” and it's definitely one of the shows that made me smile the most of just how freaking adorable it can get.  
 
This anime starts with Sora, a boy who already got used to get dangerous things  from his adventurer dad, and the shock that his next surprise is not a mortal monster that should have been kept sealed instead of sent as a present to his son, but instead an absurdly cute and small mummy called Mii-kun that gets really affectionate to Sora, this is nothing but the start of his daily life with him around. 
 
But while being the main duo, they are just a part of a show with equally likeable characters (but they are not as cute as Mii-kun, sorry, the bar was too high), his childhood friend Kazuya might look scary to everyone, but he's actually really kindhearted, and there is also Motegi and Daichi, who got closer to them due to their own affection towards the mysterious pets they end up living with, finding that way friends to talk with about them, while Sora and Kazuya are the ones that mainly get protagonism, these two also have their very good moments, especially in their introductions, the show did a nice job at making me like them from the start. 
 
One thing I really liked of this anime is how as the episodes passed, we got to understand more and more Mii-kun and the other “pets” that appear during the series, what they like, why they do x things and act the way they do... all while having lots of scenes where we see them play around together, usually mixing Sora and friends for extra comedy, and especially smiles, I know I'm repeating myself, but really, this show is adorable, their interactions are so heartwarming. 
 
The definitely weaker points of this anime were the artistic and music part, with none of the two passing the average at best, but that personally didn't affect my enjoyment towards the series. I don't go into this type of SoL shows expecting them to stand out in those aspects, if they are good and I also like the characters, even better, if not, it's totally fine, and in this case this anime did enough with that. 
 
Now that we reach the end of the review, I only have to ask a question left so you can confirm if you want to watch this show or not. Do you want to smile a lot and have a good time? If you do, start Miira no Kaikata, that's all!

    Super adorable anime!!!!! I'm so glad there is finally an anime adaption after waiting for two years since I started reading the manga on comico. All of the little creatures are so cute and it makes your heart melt, espeically Mii-kun and Isao. This anime is basically mini adventures of Sora and his friends. The plot is simple and starts with main character Sora receiving a package from his father. Inside is Mii-Kun!!! From there more characters are introduced with their partner creatures. The bonds between creature and their human companion is illustrated in this anime. We do get to see other unique creatures who live away from humans too and while it seems like a cheerful show, there are hints of a dark past that the creatures and characters go through. Sometimes seeing all the creatures reminds me of Studio Ghibli films. Artwork and music wise are ok, not my favorite but it's not bad either.  
 
Overall I liked this anime a lot! I've been reading the manga since two years ago so I had read around 100 chapters, and this anime covered quite a lot. The characters are well developed and the pacing is fine. They did change the last two episodes though, so parts of the last episode are anime original. I think the finale would have been better if they had just adapted the manga and not include the original content. Either way most of the show is very relaxing and light hearted. Watch this if you want a SOL that is cute and overall relaxing. Most of the show is not in a school with those typical school events like the school festival, studying, etc. It's more about the little creatures and what they do outside of school.  
まだ最終話は見れていませんが、毎週とても可愛いミーくんたちに癒やされて、とても幸せでした！

    A mummy, an oni, a dragon, and a baku. Sounds like a recipe for a mess doesn't it? But rather it's the opposite. Despite the supernatural beasts that make up the main creatures of the show, the center of the show is down to earth, a love story between pet and owner. 
 
Each of the pet and owner pairs are helped by coming together and being with each other. In many cases the humans are able to grow by being with the pets and caring for them, and the same can be said about the animals. Whether they need someone to care for them or someone to be able to help the pets and humans work together very well and help make lasting bonds that extend farther than what many other shows are able to do with regular human characters. And keep in mind, these are pets. They can't talk, they can only emote and act. But still even in these actions they're able to express more of who they are, and the value of their bonds better than many shows that have the power of speech. 
 
Building off of that the interactions between all of the different characters are quite great. The friends act like good friends and seem to have a pleasant time bonding with each other. However as noted above the point where it truly shines is with the pets and the humans interacting with each other. There are so many light fluffy moments between them that are so charming to watch. And there is so much love between each pair in each of the things that they do. 
 
Mii and Sora exhibit this the strongest as each of their interactions with each other shows the dedication and love that they have for each other. Mii can't stand to be too long without Sora. Sora goes out of his way to do whatever he can for Mii, whether it be reading him a bedtime story, or finding the best food for him. I'm sure many pet owners can relate with their own love towards their own pets. All of the fun ways that pets and their owners have to bond. The unique ways that you can support each other, without words yet exhibit that same love. That's what Miira is great at being able to show. They truly feel like important life partners. And they are. Because that's what pets are. Pets are magical and it certainly shows when watching Miira. 
 
The art and animation is also quite notable in my eyes. It's not special but it does a very good job of showcasing the cuteness of the supernatural creatures. Whether it be in the middle or end cards, or in the flowery flourish that accompanies a happy pet, it does well to soak in the cuteness and express the light jovial mood that the show often has.  
 
Even with all this fun and love there still are important meaningful parts. As I mentioned before the pets and humans really do help each other, and when the humans or pets backstories are gone into it's clear to see why the two are good fits for each other, and just how they're able to help. They're given actual flaws and issues, and in a show that could have just rested on it's good fluff it's great to see because it only enhances the message of the show, that is the power of pets.  
 
When I watch this show it makes me want to go give my doggies a big hug. And that's good, go find your pet and give them the love they deserve, and if you like pets, give this show a try, the creatures may be supernatural, but the love is just the same.

    Basically a 6 minute long AMV. Pretty good fight between naruto and sasuke and highlights their struggles to get where they are.

    Honestly this isn't a review, but an observation of what this six minute OVA could be. 
 
Naruto x UT, is it an awesome ova displaying some of Naruto and Sasuke's best moments from Naruto and Naruto Shippuden in arguably better animation than the anime, movies, or ovas ever had? 
Or is it a sneak peek into the future of the story? 
 
I have two possibilities of what this ova could be. 
 
1. On January 1st 2011, people in japan were able to buy T-shirts of the Naruto fame, and including the shirts, they also received a promotional ova that shows a six minute animation featuring a fight between Naruto and Sasuke, that just seems so unbelievably canon that it seems like it's showing whats to come in the future of the Naruto series. 
 
In fact, it just might be. The ova displays such events that seem to be so congruent with the anime and manga, especially to those who have been keeping up with current events in the manga. 
 
But the thing is: As of this sentence, these events had yet to happen in the anime, heck even in the manga. 
Is this ova a strange sneak peek in the future of the series? 
I would have no problem believing so, I mean why would they go and make something like this with such hi quality animation no less, or it could just be- 
 
2. A promotional ova and nothing more, but that's a little hard to believe. 
 
OVERALL: 
+ Some the best animation a Naruto series has ever displayed. 
+ A possible look in the future of the series. 
- Could just be a promotional ova, that's just coincidentally showing events that had to do with the series.

    Umm completely and utterly epic. I don't know what has just happened- maybe spoilers for the end of naruto, or an awesome professional AMV, but it was really good. I re watched it about 10 times. And to be honest, it's only 6 minutes long, so i don't see why you're still reading this, and not watching it.  
[Also, Aqua timez is an awesome band anyway, so it's all good]

    Death & Reborn was a flawless Neon Genesis movie you could give, but I do see the things about the movie that made people turn an eye to it. From what I see its the main character designs as well as the ending. I'm not going to go into detail about it because it'll contain massive spoilers but I should say the character designs and the story line of NGE: Death & Rebirth is very interesting, but it could be a turn off to the people that have seen the original Neon Genesis Evangelion before seeing the movie. Almost like the review with ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World when compared to the six mangas that comprised the entire Scott Pilgrim series

    I am a HUGE Evangelion fan but I must say Death and Rebirth is overwhelmingly meh. 
 
The first part, Death, is a pretty convoluted retelling of the anime that doesn't do a super great job of showing everything that really happened, let alone in a way that would be understandable to anyone unfamiliar with the series (which I feel would be nice, if someone wanted to watch it as a standalone film). 
 
The second part, Rebirth, is undoubtedly much better, being footage from the soon to be released End of Evangelion, but still incomplete and unsatisfying. 
 
I understand the circumstances behind this film and why it was made - people wanting a ""proper ending"" to the series, time constraints limiting the Rebirth segment, etc. I get that. I just feel it leaves a lot to be desired. 
 
Unless you're an Eva superfan who just wants to consume literally any related media you can (which is admittedly why I've watched this), you can probably skip this and go right to EoE. 
 
If you REALLY want to see the Death segment I would recommend watching Revival of Evangelion instead, it's far more complete and satisfying to watch.

    Critic's Log: Earthdate - May 19, 2012. Review #4: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth 
 
After The Finale of Neon Genesis Evangelion ended, the people that did not approve of this ending demanded for another ending, an ending that will be better. With the success of the TV series and the strong demand for another ending, two movies were made. The first one is Death and Rebirth. To be technical, The ""Death"" segment is a 70 minute recap and the ""Rebirth"" Segment is a 27 minute teaser of the next film The End of Evangelion. So, do I really have a lot to say about this? no, In fact I have seen the film and I pretend that it doesn't exist, just because the title makes little sense and The End Of Evangelion follows after the 24th episode. I will say that the Rebirth segment is good since it is setting you up for The End of Evangelion. It was set up so you can expect that the series conclusion would be promising, although I will warn you, Not everyone liked the movie ending. Death and Rebirth doesn't have much story since 70 minutes is used for recap, The Rebirth segment has the story needed but only to be seen again in The End Of Evangelion. The only segment that actually does put animation in the film is in The Rebirth segment, The Death segment is straight from the TV series, but with some slight tweaks. The animation is great in Rebirth; I don't think the Death segment is worth mentioning that much concerning animation. The music by Sagisu Shiro is just as good from the TV show. When it comes to the voice acting, The Japanese cast is superb, and I have mentioned that the dub in the TV show (I have reviewed it) is a bit of a hit and miss while being okay for the most part. The dub in this movie is GOD AWFUL. For some reason, Matt Greenfield is not in charge of the dub this time, it's Amanda Winn-Lee (That's right, the voice of Rei Ayanami from the TV show!) Some characters don't keep their English voice actors from the show and the reason is because the voice actors that did their voices probably left the industry before these two films were licensed. If you are looking for consistency in the dub from the TV show to this, this will be a disappointment for you, Shinji, Misato, Rei, Asuka, Ritsuko, and Gendo keep their voices intact. The characters go all out in Rebirth... that is until you see the same scenes over and over in the first half of The End of Evangelion. It is really nice to see Asuka kicking some butt in epic fashion. However, expect a disturbing moment involving Shinji next to a comatose Asuka, it is somewhat disturbing. I will mention it later when I review the next film. 
 
Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth was available by Manga Entertainment, this movie is obviously out of print. 
 
With that said, Death and Rebirth is an okay movie, but it is not highly recommended if you already know the story leading up to The End of Evangelion. Most of it is recap and the rest can be seen in the movie that follows. If you are a completest, go ahead and buy the movie, if you are not into recaps, just skip the movie and go straight for The End of Evangelion. I own The TV show and The End of Evangelion; I skipped Death and Rebirth because I think it was made only to get people ready for the film that follows it. 
 
I give Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth a 4 out of 10, it is SO and SO!

    Hey kids! Ever wanted a compilation movie that is completely worthless, not adding anything of note and just a complete waste of almost two hours of your life!? Well, fear not! For as Evangelion: Death And Rebirth is here for you!... Yeah this movie sucks. 
 
Applying my usual compilation movie review format, but first and foremost I must ask: Why the hell is it just one movie? The show is 26 episodes long, and even if you wanna discount the last two episodes, that’s still 24 episodes worth of material to cover. If you wanna do a compilation movie out of EVA, you’d need a flat out trilogy: The first one covering everything up to the fight with Ramiel, the second up to the moment Unit-01 Eats the S2 Engine, and the final one covering everything up to Kaworu’s death. Think the Rebuild movie without all the changes they made. 
 
So how does this movie do this? Well, not well. This is basically an elongated recap episode. At the time there was some nobelty in seeing it as there were some new scenes, but since then they have all been added to the Director’s Cut of episodes 21-24, making this movie effectively worthless. This movie could be summed up as “This is a character; here’s that character’s deal; moving on to the next one”. Rinse and repeat for a whole hour and you’ve got this movie. 
 
But wait! You might say. That is only the Death part of this movie! What about Rebirth!? Well, simple: Rebirth is just the first 30 or so minutes of End Of Evangelion. No, seriously, that’s it. The original Japanese Release did have some frames that were different from the final product, but otherwise… yeah, it’s just the beginning of End Of EVA. 
 
So did anything good come out of this movie? Well, the new scenes are nice, but as I said, they have been added to the show proper. Also, the Ending Theme, “Tamashi No Refuran” is amazing, but… yeah, that’s it really. There really isn’t much else to this movie. The only reason you should watch it is if you for some reason took forever to watch EOE and needed a refresher. Besides that, this movie is WORTHLESS! So worthless my review of it was bound to be so short because there’s that little to comment on, and that is not a compliment! 
 
Final Score: 4/10

    I can not scream enough about how much I hated this movie when I watched it. I had just finished Evangelion and like most people I was annoyed with the ending so when I heard from a friend about the Evangelion movie I thought she was talking about the 'End of Evangelion' but no she was talking about this piece of...well to put it likely shit. 
 
The movie is basically the entire series up to the last 2 episodes but the editing is choppy which makes it look like it was done by a five-year-old and whilst their are some new scenes which are not even worth watching...the movie even gets even better when their is literally a FIVE MINUTE SCENE THAT IS AN INTERMISSION before cutting to the Rebirth section which is and pardon my rage: 
THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE NEXT FILM ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME YOU MONEY GRABBING MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!! 
I apologize for the language, but I really hate this piece of shit and if anyone was considering to watch the series before watching the reboot films, just watch the original episodes and then the end of evangelion to get the full experience. 
FUCK THIS MOVIE! 
Once again, sorry for the rage. 
On the upside, the music is still good like the original series but it barely makes up for the choppy editing, music, story and the art which is barely an improvement of the last few episodes of the original. 
Overall: 3/10

    Neon Genesis Evangelion. Easily the most polarized series in anime. You either Love it, Hate it, or swing from liking it as a teen to hating it as an adult. And I most definitely can say I fall under the last item mentioned. 
 
But that is the main series.This, on the other hand, is Death and Rebirth, the recap of the entire series, and the first 30 minutes of End of Evangelion. And how well does it handle recaping? 
 
It doesn't. Flat out, The entire recap segment is a mess of scenes cut from the show (it's as if Gainax still ran out of money after NGE and made it as cheap as it could). The scenes aren't really presented in any good order either. It was an attempt to pin together the important events that effected each of the EVA pilots, but in such a way that anyone who wanted to go from this movie to End of Evangelion wouldn't understand the most important base elements from the show. For example, 
 
1. What's an Angel? 
 
2.Why did the South Pole explode? 
 
3. Why is Shinji such a grouse? 
 
4. Why is Asuka's mom talking to her inside of the EVA if she's dead? 
 
5. Why make kids pilot mechs to save the world? 
 
6. What in Sagan's name is the Human Instrumentality Project? 
 
... And it goes on and on. Now, I have seen the show, so I do know what is happening when we reach the second half, but the editing in the first half throws all the important bits out and leaves you with a mess of hatred and confusion that leads into the mess to come. 
 
The only redeeming part of this comes from Shiro Sagisu's once again great score. But at this point, you might just as well watch the show. It'll make a hell of a lot more sense and will anger you less.

    If there is one thing I hate about in any medium it would be cash-grabs to existing and popular properties. 
 
Cash-grabs, in general, is just a shitty scheme for companies in any medium to make poorly done squeals, to having unnecessary remakes and spinoff of existing properties. 95% of the time cash-grabs to popular works fail because not only do the companies would often run out of ideas but they will also heavily milk that cow even when it’s dead. Assassin’s Creed is the worst example of this. For a series that I use to love has now turned a milking cow for Ubisoft where after the release Assassin’s Creed Revelations Ubisoft has been desperately been milking the franchise by making poorly done squeals such as Assassin’s Creed Unity to unnecessary spinoffs such as Assassin’s Creed Chronicles which was a side-scrolling/Puzzle/Stealth game that not only bored me to tears but it perfectly represents how the Assassin’s Creed series has fallen just by being milked to death. 
 
The same cash grabbing bullshit can apply for anime and the biggest offender for this is easily the Naruto franchise. Not only they have made countless pointless Naruto movies but the creators for that show constantly tried it’s hardest to keep it alive by having a crap tone of filler episodes to having an awful squeal series Burto the next generation which was the creators attempt to keep the Naruto series alive even though it’s getting One For All smashed by My Hero Academia constantly. How does this cash grab bullshit relate to Neon Genesis Evangelion Death and Rebirth?  Well to put this straightforward Neon Genesis Evangelion Death and Rebirth is one of the most shameless cash-grabs to ever come out from this medium. Unlike the other two series that I just mention where I slightly give them points for trying to make they series reverent in the modern era for they respective mediums this movie has no reason to exist whatsoever and it should be burned to the ground. 
 
The first 67 minutes of this movie being the death part is a lazily done recap off all the events of the first 24 episodes off the show including the director’s cut stuff that was released later by ADV Films? Not only does this part of the movie does an aboustly horrendous job at telling all the important events off the series but it somehow manages to completely butcher certain iconic scenes from the series by adding in shitty visual directing as well having a laughable script that wasn’t present in the original series at all. 
 
Before we talk about my favorite part of this movie let’s quickly talk about the rebirth part of the movie. Despite being the first 30 minutes of End Of Evangelion where it actually has new scenes that never existed in the TV series it’s still a pointless teaser for End Of Evangelion movie where once again it only exists just to lazily draw people in. I won’t be talking about the Rebirth part of the movie because I will be talking about it in my End of Evangelion review. 
 
Now with that said let’s get to my favorite part of this movie the 4 minutes and 24-second intermission. No joke. That intermission countdown along was the best thing to come out from this movie because not only it features relaxing and chilling music but the almost fully black screen fully symbolize that the series from this point onwards is going to hell. This is easily the best part about this pointless movie. 
 
As for the visuals minus the intermission screen and the rebirth apart of the film, the visuals were shit overall thanks to the creators lazily reusing footage of the series but somehow making the visual and audio quality worse than the TV series. 
Music is still great as ever but that’s should be expected at this point. The same thing can apply for the voice acting not counting that horrendous English Dub for it. 
 
Overall minus the amazing intermission countdown screen, this movie is absolutely pointless. The Death part of the movie was horrendously directed to the aboustly core, the rebirth part of the movie despite being a 30-minute teaser of End Of Evangelion is a shitty attempt at drawing the audience in and the visuals quality in the movie is shit. 
 
If your planning to check out the Evangelion series go watch the TV series instead. This movie is not worth your time at all. 
 
Final Score 2/10

    Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth is essentially a 2 hour recap of both the 26 episode Neon Genesis Evangelion series and The End of Evangelion. 
 
The issue that I had while watching this despite it being a recap is that it felt almost hollow in how the story and other coexisting elements were conveyed to the viewer. The story seemed incredibly rushed, and there was hardly any focus at all on the character's psychological struggles as there is in the series, which is in itself a large part of Evangelion. The lack of character development coupled with the chronological displacement of clips made Death & Rebirth very difficult to follow, and left the viewer to come to their own conclusions with help from flashing text that appears throughout the movie. 
 
Death & Rebirth leaves out a vast amount of core elements that should be present (especially in a recap), near the point of being unbearable to watch. It goes as far to include characters that you would have no idea of who they were unless you weren't new to the franchise. 
 
It is highly recommended that this should not be chosen to be your first installment in the series to view, as it leaves you with little to no understanding of the plot and characters when it is viewed as a standalone piece. To get the most out of Evangelion, I suggest that you watch the 26 episode series and The End of Evangelion before watching Death & Rebirth, as this movie is more or less meant to be reflected on by the viewer after watching them to better understand the overall story of Evangelion. 
 
The 2 hour time frame simply can't do a complex story such as Evangelion's justice. Go watch the Neon Genesis Evangelion series as well as The End of Evangelion to get the fullest experience of this wonderful story, because Death & Rebirth falls flat on it's face in attempts to do so. It's still worth a watch for people interested in the complexity and depth of the story, but beyond that, don't expect anything extraordinary.

    NGE: Death and Rebirth should have been titled NGE: Completely Unnecessary Series Recap For Purpose of Make Profit From Guys with Ayanami Waifu Pillows. 
 
I have seen a lot of shameful ""cash ins"" in my years as an anime fan, but I have seen very few examples that were quite this blatant in picking the pockets of a loyal fandom. This movie was supposedly made in order to get fans PUMPED UP (read in Hans and Franz voice) for End of Evangelion, which promised to remake the final 2 episodes of the original series that so angered Japanese fans in 1996. However, this was completely unnecessary since the people that were already Eva fans were really excited to see a new ending, and I can assure you this movie didn't create any new Eva fans. Did Anno owe a large sum of money to the Yakuza!?  
 
This movie is divided into 2 parts with the largest part being an overly crammed re-telling of the first 24 episodes and the smaller part being a glorified teaser of End of Eva. Remember when EA pissed off Mass Effect fans with the shitty original ending of Mass Effect 3? Even fucking EA had the dignity to make a better ending fixing some of the original plot holes and release it for free as a DLC. If Mass Effect were made by Gainax, they would promise fans to make a new game that was just a ""fixed"" ending for Mass Effect 3, but the new ending would end up being shittier than the original ending. Death and Rebirth is like a 40$ Mass Effect DLC entirely consisting of pasted together cutscenes from the first 3 Mass Effect games in order to make fans excited for a new shitty ending! When EA has THAT much more dignity than you...that ain't good. To drive home this point, Gainax even got in legal trouble because one of the studio executives tried to evade taxes on the massive profits made by this movie. Those sons of bitches are so greedy that they rob their own devoted fans, then try to avoid paying taxes on the money that they stole!  
 
Why did I rate this a 5 then? The art and animation is actually very well done. In addition, Death and Rebirth has a lovely classical music soundtrack that is both calming and majestic. Also this isn't technically the the worst Eva cash in ever made. Only the worst directly made by Anno himself. The worst would probably be the innumerable Eva dating sims that seem to sell like hotcakes in Japan. That type of creepy otaku merchandise actually makes enough money that it is the real reason that Eva is still getting reboots and rebuilds. This isn't something Eva fanboys want to admit, but it is true. Eva isn't deeper than Serial Experiments Lain or better than Cowboy Bebop, but unlike those it keeps trucking on because creepy guys in their 30s REALLY want to bang a certain blue haired 15 year old. It kind of makes me sad to be an Eva fan. 
 
When it comes to Eva, people are mostly divided into the zealous 2deep4you fanboys and the vitriol spewing Eva bashers. I occupy a middle ground and whereas I recognize the kinks and flaws of the series, I generally appreciate its contribution to anime culture and Anno's efforts to explore psychoanalysis and heroically battle his own clinical depression through the medium of art. Unfortunately, I just can't defend Death and Rebirth. Unlike the original series or End of Eva, this movie wasn't an example of Anno daring to bare his problems, his sorrow, his soul to us and break the conventions of shonen anime storytelling. Death and Rebirth is nothing but a shallow attempt to gouge some cash and betray all those otaku and hikikomori that idolized Anno.

    Death and Rebirth is a two-hour long movie that consists of two halves -- Death and Rebirth, each about an hour long.  Rebirth will not be covered in this review, as its footage was expanded on and included in The End of Evangelion.  It was produced by Production IG (famous for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC) and Gainax (famous for their work on His and Her Circumstances and FLCL), and directed by Hideaki Anno (famous for his work on the original Gunbuster OVA and His and Her Circumstances).  It was released on March 15th, 1997, and has been licensed Stateside by Manga Entertainment, and was originally released on July 30th, 2002. 
 
So, what we're left with is Death -- which is more or less the entire series in an hour-long recap with minimal new footage, and lots of flashing text, like we saw more in the second half of Evangelion. 
 
Do I think this was worth it?  Having just finished the series and gone onto this, I found that I didn't really need a complete recap of the series, as Death covered the most important events from the series, most of which were pretty memorable anyways.   
 
There's not really a lot to say about anything besides that, as you've pretty much seen it before this if you've watched the series. 
 
All in all, if you don't have the time to watch the entire series, then yes, this is worth a watch.  But if you have seen the series, it's a waste of your time.

    I love ""Death and Rebirth"", I really do. In my mind, it's probably the least flawed segment in the Evangelion franchise. But I guess I know why people are rating it so low. 
 
There are two reason people tend to give this movie a low score. The first reason is that this movie is split cleanly into two halves, and the first half, named ""Death"", is essentially a recap. I think most people just aren't as patient as I am and loathe recaps in general. ""Death"" deserves mention though, because they're probably the most well done recaps I've ever watched. It's not just scenes from the Evangelion series edited together, there is a considerable amount new footage and narration added in that combine to make the events that happened in the series a lot clearer (though there is still a good deal I didn't understand by the time I finished it). The edit is done extremely cleverly, retelling the story from several personal perspectives, all revolving around the theme of Shinji, Rei, Asuka and Kaworu turning up to the auditorium for a rehearsal of Pachebel's ""Kanon in D-dur"". I love the rendition that piece along with others such one of Bach's cello preludes. The classical music is used throughout the ""Death"" segment to great effect, lending it a certain elegance that the series, often riddled with cliches, sometimes lacked. This isn't the only improvement either. Since the recaps cherry picked key moments from the series really well, and got rid of most of the less interesting angel-of-the-week padding, it's not only easier to connect the dots in the story, but also gives ""Death"" a greater intensity and urgency when compared against the series. It's through this that I caught a glimpse of the greatness that people often go on about when they talk about Evangelion. 
 
The second reason people hated this is because of the second half, ""Rebirth"". And no, it's not because ""Rebirth"" itself is crap, not by any stretch of the imagination. The reason people hate it is because ""Rebirth"" is repeated in its entirety by the follow up movie, ""End of Evangelion"", which kind of reduces ""Death and Rebirth"" to nothing more than a recap movie. But to be fair, since ""Death and Rebirth"" came before ""End of Evangelion"", I think it make sense that the latter should be one that gets the heavier penalisation for repeating what's already been shown in the former. The segment in question itself is excellent. Though it lasts less than half an hour, it's a very compelling watch with sky high production values. It really sets up the ""End of Evangelion"" movie in style, ending on a scene that made me want to continue on to the final movie immediately. 
 
There really isn't anything majorly wrong with ""Death and Rebirth"", the few complaints I have are all rather minor. For one, some of the words that flash up on screen during ""Death"" disappears far too quickly and I couldn't read a lot of them - what's the point of having it at all if they're so hard to read? For another, at the start of ""Rebirth"", Shinji does something pretty f*cked up that I feel isn't really consistent with his cowardly character, so I chalked that scene down to something that's there for shock value more than anything else. Finally, there's the intermission. Yeah, that's right, this movie even has its own built in intermission. In a way, I didn't mind the idea itself. But considering the intermission lasts not one but TWO songs, and comes after the 5min+ ending credits of ""Death""... that totals up to about ten minutes of doing nothing (although the ending credits of ""Death"" does have ""Kanon D-dur"" as backing music, so I didn't mind it so much"")! It's all a bit too much really. 
 
If you haven't seen the series, there is no point at all in watching this. Prior to ""End of Evangelion"" coming out, watching ""Death and Rebirth"" after the series made perfect sense - I believe it was released a year or two after the series (though don't quote me on this), and so the first half served as a nice condensed reminder (with bonus new footage) of what happened in the series while the second half wets the appetite for the finale. ""Death and Rebirth"" served its purpose as a bridge perfectly back then, but with ""End of Evangelion"" eliminating the need to watch the second part entirely, is this still worth watching just for the (admittedly beefed up) recaps? Well, it really depends on you. If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, or if like me, you want to watch these kind of things for completeness, then yes. If there's only one recap that you'll ever watch, then make it this one.

    I really liked this when it started airing. It was my most looked forward to show weekly. So I'm sad to say that I can't bring myself to give it any higher than a 7, because towards the last few episodes it just wasn't as satisfying to watch anymore. 
 
Art and animation: it's really pretty, and the animation is quite impressive at times. You'll get grand explosions or nice scenery and good facial expressions. 
 
My enjoyment for it alone made me think it'd be a 8 from the start based on that alone, but it sort of faltered towards the end and therefore it's a 7 now. But overall I had fun watching and it was worth my time - I don't regret watching at all. 
 
Character: characters are memorable, at least. Characters from the past season are there and lovable as before - or more now, having matured. But important as they still are the newly introduced characters are the ones the plot revolves around. And that's where the differing opinions come in about whether they are good characters or not. Personally I think they're fine and interesting to watch, and can be pretty quirky. But I have to admit that how much I like the new characters depends on what kind of situations they are put into - their behaviours make me smile sometimes, but at times they give me a headache. Character interactions can be done really really well - that's what I loved about the characters - but I think at parts they can also be cringey or unnatural. 
 
Story: The overall story ends up not being as strong as I'd hoped. There are interesting elements, but it doesn't really get anywhere for some time at the start. But when things started moving midway was when I think the show started becoming really enjoyable. Here's when we watchers eagerly watch on and see how things will be resolved while excitedly discussing whether we think it should end happily/not happily/etc for the characters involved, and why. It was very much enjoyable to see the good/bad sides of the show and the conflicting interests of our cast. 
I think how everything got resolved ended up being a bit disappointing. After the whole season of ""who's bad, who's good, what's the right thing to do?"", the resolution ends up being sort of anti-climactic in my opinion. In the finale there were times I thought ""ugh, are you really going to do that?!"". The ending had happy moments, sad moments, and did give us time to have a proper conclusion for everyone. That's one good thing. Whether or not the conclusions were satisfactory or not probably depends on the the individual though. At least, one good thing I'll say is that the ending tries to tie up all the ends and what happens. Most shows just end abruptly. 
 
Overall: 
So what's good about this show? Well, it's fun, and it gets good near the middle. The characters grow on you, and the character interactions are for the most part, natural and fun. They can be pretty humorous too, with how they act despite being thrown into weird situations. The animation is great as well. Enjoyment wise, I overall rate it quite highly for most of the series. The series also isn't afraid to take risks, and deaths can be commonplace. So it really makes you wonder how dire things can end up being. There are some good twists in there. And some really good storytelling. 
 
I think the story could have ended better, it might have been a bit rushed at the end. But there was much time given after the climax for us to understand what happens in the aftermath, so that's good. The romance is also hit and miss, and because it's a important factor/motivation for our MC, the conclusion of the show is something you'll probably either like or dislike. 
 
tldr; 
Fun? Very much, for the most part 
Worth the time? Mostly, imo. 
Regret watching? Never. 
Good? Middle part > starting > ending, overall ok 
Would you like it? Idk, but worth a try really.

    For the most part Virgin Soul seems like its going to be better than Genesis, but then when it finishes, it just feels empty.  Like, it could have delivered more than it did, but it was so dead set on cramming the romance angle into the finish of the story, than truly delivering the realism and great finish it could have and should have had, that the whole ending suffered.  There is a reason that most animes don't have the Protagonist and the Antagonist in the kind of relationship that Nina and Chris were in: It just doesn't work and causes logic holes all throughout the story.  Still, it was a very good anime for the most part, and while the ending was a bit lacking, you'd still very much enjoy the first 21-22 episodes.

    Before I begin all the review,let me tell you something. 
This review will contain major spoilers so those who still have plans to watch the anime,here is a shorter version. 
If you enjoyed 1st season,you will enjoy it till episode 22 maybe,except the fact that it might make you rage so much.After that,you may curse the makers. 
1)Story: 
They tried so hard to make it good,they definitely somewhat succeeded but then something happened that made it plunge so hard that it crashed. 
First they killed El,which made me rage so much that i was about to break my display,but it was part of the plan and it would fit in the story.Then the war they broke out began the disaster.Chris just goes to Eibos to kill Bahamut?That was a mistake.They could make it work by another war between King and Gods which would had opened up the rift and then Bahamut would appear.After that,they Killed Kaisar,like one of the main character of the both series dies?That doesn't make sense.How are we supposed to look forward to 3rd season.Alessand's dramatic death was also a disaster.And the fact that Amira is still trapped also didn't do any good,people like me wants her to be with Favaro. 
Additionally,they rushed the last two episodes which can be a downfall for any anime,the should have made one or two more episodes. 
I am giving rating of the story as an overall,it could have been 8 at least but the last two episodes just don't fit well with the rest. 
6/10 
2)Art and Sound: 
One thing that this anime didn't suck at all was its art and sound,i have seen some flaws in animations of other animes that were released in 2017 but i am happy that this one didn't have,its first season is one of my favourites so I am happy.The war,Bahamut,ball,and the one where Nina danced with Chris at the first time were good.Good Effort! 
8/10 
3)Character Development: 
The story is of after the Fall of Cocytus where the demon kind is having hard time to live,they even mad Cerberus a toy.How the King,Nina and Mugaro feel,their personalities and stuff was were explained good,the two faced King also looked good. 
8/10 
4)Enjoyment: 
I could have easily give it a 10 but the last two episodes just became a downfall.Making El's death an exception,the story went smooth.Even if we were not ready for his death,it would still fit in the arc but they treated the last two episodes badly.Even Kaisar's last words didn't made sense to me,""Death is peaceful""?It only makes sense if we believe that he was protecting his pride by protecting him,but then again,he should have said something else.Jeanne got away from death without a scratch at the end was also not good,they should have injured her a little bit(Not killing her of course) 
6/10 
5)Overall: 
I have said it all,so i have no other words. 
7/10

    If you can overlook the literally pointless enslavement of demons by humans, then this series ain't so bad.  
 
However I disagree with some other reviews that say this is an awful sequel to Genesis. Really, all that happened was we have MORE time to notice the flaw in their writing and planning.  
1) the returning characters weren't intended to be the main characters, only as the main supporting cast; they only received more screentime due to it being a long series. 2) the romance ain't different or somehow more focused on than it was in Genesis, except we had more episodes to focus on it. 3) the writing is in no way different (let alone worse) than it was in Genesis.  
 
Further commentary below will contain at least partial spoilers.  
 
--  
 
STORY (6/10)  
My primary issue with Rage of Bahamut is the writing team has great setup and main plot, but along the way, they fail hard in pacing and in thinking things beyond character intros. This was an issue in Genesis and is how I'm far from agreeing that Virgin Soul is any worse. In reality: we merely had more time to notice it.  
 
For Virgin Soul, the writers DID NOT AT ALL plan for the end. Or, kinda, even the middle of the dang story.  
 
One room for complaint is how it had such a vast established world to use (tho also ignored mostly in Genesis), but instead they opted to keep the setting more-or-less in three areas; the human Capital, the prison at said-Capital, and the God Realm. Had they planned things out for the long-run, then this would've actually been fine. But they didn't. And so we were allowed nonstop reminders of plot holes, failures, and just a bunch of complaints that would require pure spoilers to address. Only pure-ish spoiler I'll give is THE DEMONS AS A WHOLE DIDN'T HAVE A REASON TO BE ENSLAVED  
 
.  
 
ART (9/10)  
I don't mind the random CGI usage for townies and whatnot. In truth, it was tons better than the CGI they used in Genesis so it's great to see they actually focused on improving it. I also can't mind it when it kept the rest of the art consistent for such a highly detailed series.  
 
Some problems: 1) While I applaud eternally for the beautiful, realistically timed reactions, some pauses before scene changes took far too long. Even if they planned for a commercial break after these moments, it lasted too long. 2) NOT. A. SINGLE. CHARACTER'S physical changes show. You have members who look pretty much the same as they did TEN YEARS AGO, and then members who went to prison and were told they lost weight but not look a pound lighter than when they were sentenced. Honestly, do humans not age?? 3) they they removed the lip colors for the males - I DEMAND EQUALITY IN PRETTY LIPS THANK YOU! They also didn't remove the male lips in the few flashbacks from Genesis either so... yeah, further insult to the flawless beauty that once was!  
 
Other than that tho, there wasn't anything too different from their design quality from Genesis (including the crappy no-bra-yet-pushed-up boobs); everything matched the world well ... Ah, that's a lie; they actually fixed the issue of the Gods' luminescence overload. It was slightly corrected in the few flashbacks from Genesis too, but that could've just been a filter side-effect. But tbh, I would've preferred a tad more luminescence just so they still look ""Godly"" while also being able to make-out their designs outside of close-ups.  
 
.  
 
SOUND (5/10)  
I don't care about Rage of Bahamut's OST. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't the focus anywhere and it didn't really change my mood whilst watching the scenes. Vocals weren't off-putting either, and the SFX were well used through-out the series.  
 
.  
 
CHARACTER (9/10)  
The only poor and inconsistent cast was in the poor writing. Everything else about the characters was actually very smooth and pretty refreshing; returning characters didn't face some sudden change either (tho as it WAS 10yrs later, it's kinda weird how there wasn't any). Really, there was so much room to expand on stuff but they just didn't bother ;;  
 
However, I do need to address that unlike Genesis, there was an actual message in Virgin Soul: one doesn't have to be ""perfect"" in order to be loved or any less genuine. Meanwhile, what I got from Genesis was ""it's okay to fall for a literal 5-year-old because she's physically 20"" and the generic trope of not everyone oozing their full potential as if it was a fairytale. Sadly, Virgin Soul's writing didn't really reflect this so I think others will forget this message they even blatantly addressed.  
 
.  
 
ENJOYMENT (8/10)  
I'm not a huge fan on long fight scenes. And that's more-or-less how the series concluded itself, so I wasn't that interested at the end. Not a poor decision to have the concluding fight at the end, but I continuously had to restrain myself from skipping forward even tho I knew I'd miss out on small details.  
 
But during the majority of the series, I didn't dislike the story or characters enough to be disinterested or upset. Aside from painfully obvious plot holes and forgetting the severity of the events during serious times (not for comedic or other relief from drama), I was able to enjoy it and continue watching despite having work in the morning. But then with how things ended, it was so backwards in some regards that I couldn't ignore how upset I was despite the good aspects ;;  
 
 
.  
 
OVERALL (8/10)  
It's seriously just the writing that's so bad about Rage of Bahamut in general. Sure it still puts some other (mainstream) series to shame, but it has so many issues that could've been avoided with some BASIC PLANNING that it's unable to be overlooked. Sadly, Virgin Soul's taking the blame for something that Genesis did as well.

    After watching Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul, I was actually pleasantly surprised by it. The story is pretty good and it's a fresh look on the world the previous series dabbled in. There was enough new mixed with the old and the exploration on the characters and their motivations was a welcomed change of pace. It wasn't as action pact as the previous series, but I think it still held itself well. There are also quiet a few emotional moments, too. The ending is a little mixed for me. I like how it turned out for some characters, but some elements could have been better. Despite that, I still think it was a good ending to the series. 
 
I really recommend giving it a watch if you want to see how the previous series's characters develop!

    I will start with this, i never watched the original story so i'm come here for those who havent watched the first story. You don't NEED to watch the first if you don't want to, it will add to your understanding and give background but none is needed to enjoy and understand whats going on. 
 
There are many downfalls to the season that make it a tad difficult to watch, some being characters decisions not making any sense to the point that its obvious that they are like that just to keep the story going and forced plot. 
There's little to no character growth, only, and i mean only the main gets some growth. 
 
That being said i stuck it though and did really like it over all. The art is beautiful, the sound is amazing. The over all story is good just poorly executed but i did really enjoy the season and have no regrets watching it all.

    This review will be extremely quick and only highlight what I believe are the major things the anime hit home, following the rubric provided by the website.  
 
Story: Highly disappointing. Genesis did it much better, and this made me think that the creators wanted to mimic the same success by trying to make a formula without soul. Yes, the ideas are still interesting, yes the concept is cool, the world building is nice, just like Genesis. The story started out interesting, with the rag demon and the new primary character (Nina), with appearances from previous characters, but things went south by the second half. The plot twist was forced, the romance seemed unnatural and was underdeveloped, and they made a really bad move in regards to a certain character and his fate. I would argue they actually did that twice.  
 
Art: I'm still a fan of the art. I think it's very visually appealing, and the animation is pretty good. There is some 3D animation included, but it blends in quite well and isn't a nuisance.  
 
Sound: First OP was good, and I think they should have kept it. I didn't like the second OP.  
 
Character: Flat. A lot of them. They tried to give backstories to flesh them out, but it wasn't all that effective, especially with Charioce. I wasn't a fan of how they played out his duality and the reasoning they gave for their extremely stupid move (the move which drives the entire plot). It's not something a king would do, and make the entire anime suddenly pointless (especially with the revelation at the end). Additionally, they included the old cast (probably for fan-service) but all they had going for them ended up being nostalgia and stereotypes.  
 
Enjoyment: 6/10. The first half got me excited, I was planning on rating it an 8 or 9, but man that ending killed it for me. Very unsatisfactory.

    I watched this anime for two things 
* A strong female lead 
* An interesting, adventurous storyline 
 
I can't exactly say I didn't get that. 
It might be useful to add that this is the first Shingeki no Bahumut related thing that I have seen, so I have nothing to compare it to. 
 
Story 6/10 
 
At first, the story is wonderful. Nina meets certain people who end up relying on her power and so on in order to rebel against the king. Just when things started to look really good, and I was certain that this would be a big 10/10 that I could tick off my list, the worst happened. 
The story turned AWAY from the action and intrigue, and decided to focus on ROMANCE. 
I knew there would probably be some type of romance subplot, but I didn't think it would suddenly become something that resembled Fushigi Yuugi. 
Suddenly, Nina, who can be a clown but very strong-willed about being used just for her power, only cares about her love interest and worrying about the future, when will she see him again, *insert tired groan here*. 
This anime was great, until they hinged the whole story on it's weakest point. I was hoping to see more Azazel but he ended up fading into the background after his plot convenient factor had run its course. It might mention that he's a main character, but don't that fool you about his involvement. 
 
Art 10/10 
Gorgeous. Stunning. It felt very fluid and unique. 
 
Sound 6/10  
My impression is that the sound was good for what it was used for. There was nothing extraordinary about it that made me want to listen again and again, but it certainly isn't a boring soundtrack. 
 
Character 7/10 
As usual, most of my overall score is swayed by the characters, and these ones were... interesting. 
When she isn't fawning over her ridiculous love story, Nina is actually a pretty cool person. She is stubborn and a bit cocky, but that adds to her likeability; which only makes the love story make me even more frustrated. 
She's proud of her abilities and of her origins, and has no problem showing off her unnatural strength in arm-wrestling matches. 
THIS is the stuff that should have been highlighted more in the anime, instead of reducing her to a snivelling 'girl in love'. 
 
Anyway. 
The most interesting character for me was Mugaro - one of the supporting characters. The subplot surrounding him was very interesting, and a welcomed distraction from Nina's love story dilemma. 
He is the character to whom most have a fondness for, and I think this is one of the things that helps meld this dynamic group of people into a working, functioning group. 
 
Then there is the other half to this love story whom I won't name for 'spoiler purposes' although it doesn't matter much. 
He underwent a HUGE personality change - some of it I could keep up with, and some of it just seemed ridiculous. He is introduced as completely ruthless, but is then shown to have a softer side when he meets Nina (in an arm wrestling match of all things). You want me to believe that this man isn't completely cold and cruel when he spends time with a bouncy, energetic girl, that's totally fine. 
But then I'm supposed to believe that in the span of 1-3 episodes, he has completely disposed of his arrogant, 'I am the strongest and I know best' attitude. 
That's pushing it a little too much, to say the least. 
 
Enjoyment 7/10 
 
Despite the frustrations that I had, I don't regret watching the show. It might seem like a really bad sequel - and maybe it is, as I said, I haven't watched the previous Shingeki no Bahamut - but I think it does hold it's own as a show; as long as you aren't in it purely for an action/adventure.  
 
Overall 8/10 
The bittersweet ending made for a pretty unsatisfying ending. So much happened, and yet the only thing that gets focused on for the most part is this love story. If the romance could have been sidelined then this probably would have been a much better product. 
However, there was still plenty that I enjoyed (it takes at least 13 episodes before romance really begins to domineer). It could be comedic, which was probably it's saving grace in this score, since the pressure of actually having a good story lightens a little when it is accentuated that Nina is just this powerfully strong disaster that explodes every time a young man makes her heart race.

    I’ve seen Genesis, I’m sure most of the people who have watched Virgin Soul have aswell. And as you can see, they aren’t happy. So I’ll get to the point, if you are coming to see this as a sequel then just stop while you still can. As this anime stands, it’s nowhere near good enough to be called a sequel to Genesis. However if you are watching this just to see an anime that is viewed as a stand-alone experience then I would give it a chance. Overall the story is basic and the characters are your run of the mill experience, yes this includes the ones coming back from Genesis, sorry not sorry, the music is your standard mix of English and Japanese to form some blend I guess in hopes of making American viewers happy, and the art is still just as good if not better than Genesis. So it’s really a situation of people who came to see this as a continuation of Genesis versus people who just came to watch an anime that isn’t so bad you’ll have to stop midway. And yes, it is definitely made apparent that this was made for the latter. To sum up what I’m saying, watch this with the intent of it being stand-alone, not as a sequel. You’ll only be disappointed.

    It is very clear from all the poor reviews of this show that, if you come to this series comparing it to its predecessor you will be disappointed.   
 
As it happened through a stroke of luck (Amazon Prime failed to label the show properly), I watched Virgin Souls without having seen Genesis.  I had no idea until half way through and having discussed the series with a friend that this was a sequel. 
 
Thus it goes without saying that this series stands on its own.  Most importantly, it achieves everything that it sets out to achieve. 
 
It's a Romance.  A very high production value Romace.  It's main character Nina adds much needed levity to a series that would otherwise be waaay too dark for my taste.  But fortunately the series isn't entirely about her.  Charioce is a complex character: he's a terrible guy, with a truly soft spot (such characters have existed in history).  Characterization was only graded an 8 because there were moments when I did think Nina, or some other character could have benefited from a break in their normal routine selves.   
 
Supporting characters: Kaiser has the only true Arc in the story (ending in a different personality and world view than where he began).  Azazel was the tragic character of this story.   
 
Could the show have gone deeper?  Probably, but not every series can or should be Game of Thrones, or hyper action hero oriented.  The action is a vehicle for the drama, and the drama never gets so thick that the plot won't move forward (7 Seasons of Game of Thrones and still no Night King).  The balance is there.  Me and my wife binged this in 3 nights.  AMAZING show!  Take it at face value.

    Shingeki no Bahamut, a sequel to Genesis. Oh boy. The hype was real when i heard it was coming out, as i didn't expect a second season. This is my review after watching all the episodes. (Very little spoilers) 
 
Story: 6/10 
                 The story ( Not giving too much away) was very... complicated. Based around Nina, a girl who can transform into a dragon with demons, angels and humans thrown into the mix. Sounds lovely right? The first half of the season was paced quite nicely,  so why do i give the story 6/10?  
         
The second half was lacklustre. From a nice, consistent and smooth plot,  immediately it begins to take a twist into the realms of mind fuckery. Truth was at first i was like ""wow, i did not expect this"". But god did it feel so unnecessary as it inevitably led me to wonder why they didn't do it in such and such a way (Plot holes). The ending itself was very rushed, almost as though they clamped the jigsaw puzzle down together in the last 2 episodes... even then it felt incomplete. They also decided to follow the narrative story telling approach randomly during the second half.  
 
Art: 10/10 
 
The art honestly was very beautiful. Every scene was magical. The transitions between different scenes flowed smooth like the ocean.  One scene in particular ( the dancing scene ) really catches my eye. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
Of course, it's very rare that a sequel manages to live up to it's prequel in the case of an OP/ED. Many people seem to not like it, personally, I found it quite nice to listen to, even if it didn't live up to the prequel. 
 
Character: 7/10 
 
Focusing on Nina and Charioce,  character development was 10/10 for them (not going to spoil anything). HOWEVER,  i  wish they focused on the side characters more (such as Rita and Kaisar) , which again they rarely did in the second half. This is to be expected by viewers to want more from Favaro and Kaisar, even though the show isn't based around them, they ARE still the main characters from the prequel. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
 
It never did live up the prequel, mainly with consistency throughout the anime. 
Many plot holes. 
It's still one of the better anime this season. 
Fun to watch, very unique anime. 
The art is so beautiful 
I cried, i laughed, i smiled. that's an 8/10 from me =) 
 
Take care and have a good day!@

    Virgin Soul, the sequel to Genesis is a near masterpiece.  Coming in at a 9 out of 10 this is worth watching.  Time and time again, episodes push the boundaries of what you expect of the show until you come to the end and realize what a great journey it all was.  This show's attention to detail and grandiose ambitions move it to near masterpiece as the story is a beautiful one.  Time and time again epic scenes play out in their full glory in ways other studios would have folded and compromised under the immensity of a 24 episode project with so many epic battles.

    Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis was a show that lived by its characters and died by its plot. The show kind of came out of left field in Fall 2014. It was an adaptation of a mobile game (or gotcha game) and was coming from a fairly new studio Mappa. Although it started under the radar, it did not take long for the show to pick up steam, and it even ended up being one of the most popular and hyped shows of its season. The lead characters, Kaiser and Favaro, were outstanding, and it had several side characters to give them a run for their money. Personally, I think the cast is one the best in anime and at bare minimum one of the most fun. Sadly, the plot could not back up its ridiculously good character lineup. Genesis started as a character driven adventure story, but ended up a rather generic fantasy-action show by the end of its run. Even though I do not think the show is a must watch, I would still recommend it for its quality characters, especially its leads. 
 
Luckily, most of the cast is back for another season, Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul. Although Kaiser and Favaro take a back seat in the second season, they are replaced with equally great leads, Nina and Charioce… or so it seemed. Both Nina and Charioce started off absolutely fantastic, but they end utterly abysmal, as they are some of the most butchered character arcs I have ever seen. Although Nina’s character is totally wrecked by the end of the series, all her faults end up tying back to Charioce, and he does not stop after destroying Nina and himself, as he goes so far to make both Favaro and Kaiser come crashing down with them. Charioce is certainly the most disappointing character I have seen in recent years and is certainly in the running for overall worst character in anime, as he drags multiple otherwise great characters down into the grave with him. 
 
Charioce plays the role of the main villain of Virgin Soul and starts of as a pretty damn good one. Virgin Soul picks up ten years after the events of Genesis, and Charioce has been crowned the new king in the time between them. It is never really made clear how much power he holds as king, but it seems he pretty much has power over the entire human race. Although he is essentially the head pin of humanity, he focuses on furthering his own goals rather helping others, so to call Charioce evil would be an understatement, as he uses his power and charisma to enslave demons, murder, imprison the innocent, kidnap, and manipulate. He is pretty much the ultimate villain, and even if someone this evil may sound more cartoony rather than an actual person, he isn't. The show makes sure that viewer understands he does all these horrible things not because he is some madman, but because he has goals he wants to achieve no matter the cost. Charioce is evil, but even if he has his reasons for being evil, he is still evil. 
 
Let us take a look at how Charioce is introduced at the beginning of Virgin Soul. After the catastrophe of the massive dragon Bahamut, it was Charioce who helped humanity back on its feet after he took the role of King, but to do this, he had to turn his back against their old allies, the angels and cruelly enslaved their old enemies, the demons. Although he built up the humans, he did so on the blood of others. Charioce would do anything and everything to make his dream come true, even if that meant he had to kill and betray countless times to get there, and as the show unfolds, Charioce only adds to the list of atrocities he has committed. A person like this, so tunnel visioned by their ambitions that they throw compassion out the window, makes for a very interesting villain, because it lets you empathize with them even though you know they can never truly be forgiven for their previous actions. In the last act of the anime, it is revealed that Charioce’s goal is to put an end to Bahamut, as the attack ten years ago was responsible for the death of his mother. As it stood, Bahamut would eventually return, so he chooses to resurrect him (killing numerous more people) so that he can finish him once and for all. 
 
It is all fine and dandy that Virgin Soul wants me to sympathize with Charioce, but it cannot try and tell me that I should forgive him, or should they let not one, but basically their entire cast of characters show him forgiveness. All the horrible things that Charioce did are forgotten about when they find out that Charioce was (kinda) doing a good thing for the world in the end. This is complete bullshit! The ends do not always justify the means. Even if humanity does benefit from Charioce’s plans, he is still only selfishly doing it to get revenge for his mother. Charioce can have his reasons for the crimes he committed, but those reasons should not mean that everything he did should just go away (especially when a lot of it had little to nothing to do with killing Bahamut in the end), and it does not. This one decision Virgin Soul made killed everything the show built up to at that point. 
 
Charioce's redemption also gets to ruin several other characters alongside his own. Nina, the new protagonist of this season, falls in love with Charioce and wants to separate the two sides she sees in him, the first side, the person she loves and the second side, the evil king responsible for countless heartless acts. When Nina finally realizes that her loved one and her enemy are the same person, she somewhat reluctantly decides she still needs to stand against him, even at the cost of letting go of the person she loves. Up to this point, Nina’s character is still quite good, and even if she decided to jump ship and stand next to the king, because said king is also the one she loves, I would not of faulted her character for it. That is not the case though, she decides that no matter what, Charioce must be stopped and his crimes cannot go unpunished, but after hearing a BS excuse for his actions, Nina immediately forgives him going against everything her character just stood for at that point. Forgiving Charioce single-handedly killed Nina’s character arc, and hers was not the only one butchered by this very same action. 
 
Favaro and Kaiser have almost two full seasons of being great characters with firm beliefs and moral standings, but forgiving Charioce made everything come tumbling down for them too. Favaro supports Nina for choosing to choose Charioce over her own identity—dumb but grounded in the idea that love triumphs over all. Favaro chose to selflessly save the world over the girl he loved, Amira, at the climax of the first season, but he tells Nina to put her own love over everything else, because he wishes he could go back and do the same, throwing his previous character arc out of the window. It was certainly disappointing to see Favaro’s character U-turn like this, but it was even more disappointing witnessing Kaiser’s downfall. 
 
Kaiser was always a person who stood strongly for his personal idea of justice. At the start of Genesis, Kaiser was a knight who fought against Favaro, because he was a criminal bounty hunter, but after he realizes his adversary is less of a crook than he originally thought, he does not hesitate to jump ship, joining Favaro, and even fight against some of his old allies. The reason Kaiser became a knight in the first place is because he wanted to spend his life fighting for his beliefs, so when he figures out Charioce is not the good-wholesome king he and everyone else thought he was, he quickly starts to rethink his position. Kaiser has always been loyal to justice, not loyal to the king. He jumps ship, in a similar way to Genesis, and joins Favaro and Nina in a rebellion against Charioce, but after finding out that Charioce had ""reasons"" for committing SOME of his crimes, Kaiser instantly forgives him going so far to even (spoilers) give his own life to save his. This completely goes against what Kaiser has stood for this entire time, sparing a mass murder because he is maybe kind of a little bit sorry. Kaiser forgiving Charioce to the extent of laying down his life for him is insanely out of character and goes against all his core beliefs. At least Nina and Favaro were bounty hunters with at least a little moral ambiguity, but Kaiser is literally a knight that is supposed to be fighting for justice. 
 
Luckily, not everyone is so quick to jump on the Charioce-forgiveness bandwagon. Two characters, Azazel and Jeanne d’Arc, do not agree with the retribution everyone else seems to be giving Charioce. Both Azazel and Jeanne have one extra thing they hold Charioce responsible for on top of all his other crimes, the death of their son (pretty much adopted son in Azazel’s case), Mugaro. Although Charioce did not directly kill Mugaro (that criminal act goes to one of his men, Alessand) he tried to multiple times, so when Alessand kills him to gain his approval, Azazel and Jeanne still hold him accountable to a large degree. Azazel and Jeanne have every right to hate Charioce for both personal and general reasons… This is Virgin Soul though, so, of course, the show decides the paint them in wrong and Charioce in the right, because did not you know? Charioce did all those horrible things in an attempt to stop a dormant Bahamut by resurrecting him, killing more in the process. Fuck, man. Can Virgin Soul do anything right? 
 
Virgin Soul was actually a pretty good anime up until Charioce’s redemption, so am I going to hard on a single plot point? Maybe, but they fucked up so hard with Charioce that his problems actually became everyone else’s. Charioce, in my opinion, will most definitely go down as one the biggest blunders in anime history. He had so much potential as a character and lived up to none of it, just like Virgin Soul. Genesis was a really good anime despite having a lot of problems and rather than fixing those problems, Virgin Soul gave us Charioce.

    (DISCLAIMER) First of all: I have not yet watched the first season. This might seem strange, but it's easily explained by me watching amvs about this anime, copy- and pasting the name and not checking for previous seasons. 
 
(THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE) 
 
So, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I probably should have. The strory is very similar to other anime, some social issues get touched upon- plus points for having good and evil/ not likeable characters on every side. About the story there isn't much to say, but I must say that for me it seemed to make sense, the way that things were happening. It was easy to just ignore most of the plot holes. 
 
The world building was as stupid as we usually get for stories like these, where maybe small enviroments like the cities kinda make sense, but we never really get a good grasp of the whole actualy world. We just jump from location to location. 
 
Art and Sound were decent, in some scenes exceptionally good. Interesting angles, animations- the dance scenes were done amazingly in my opinion. The animation could've been a bit smoother at times in my opinion, didn't bother me too much though. The music amplified emotions and the choral singing was used very well. 
 
And now Characters: A lot of people might disagree, but I think that Nina's and Charioce's relationship was very interesting. It is one of the key themes and story elements in this anime, so if you do not like this couple at all it could be annoying, for me it was one of the main reasons to keep watching, if not THE reason. Most of the characters are very quirky, they either look weird or act silly, but they still seem grounded in reality to a certain extend. Rita, the zombie-doctor, seems not phased by anything at first and because of that like a character that's difficult to relate to, but then she  reveals herself to be very compassionate and to sincerely care for her friends. 
The main character, Nina, is very light hearted and free spirited, because of which she does not seem to suit the rest of the characters who are dealing with very 'serious' issues right from the beginning and she acts more like comic relief, being the person who accidentaly got caught up in that mess. As the story progresses and she grows close to the other characters, the strengh in her bubbliness and her way of dealing with trauma and personal issues gets shown more clearly, which then makes her a serious character at the end. In these 24 episodes all the characters that from my understanding weren't in the first season, change a lot and some have even drastic character developement. 
The fan service: the clothing was sometimes/ quite often very short and skimpy, which I did not enjoy all that much (as a straight gal), but it didn't make the scenes too laughable. It knows when to fanservice, and during sad sequences cleavage is not too noticeable. 
 
Generally I would in a way compare this to Rokka no Yuusha, because there as well no completely new and exciting themes were discussed, but the one's that were touched upon are explained quite in depth. Also similar to RnY are the characters that we all have seen in one way or another before, but still having facests added that make them unique. 
 
Apparently this anime hasn't done very well and the chance of a third season is very low, but I will keep hoping to get something, if only because the romance was interesting and not stereotypical. 
 
You should definetly give this a go, but if you're coming from the first season you should regard this as a new story with some old characters you already like, and try to give the new characters some time to grow on you.

    Well this is an overall disapointment of a show, after a good first season we leave for a new adventure with bad caracthers, bad plot and with no goal in sight. 
 
People would say its an adventure but its more like the diary of 16 year old girl than anything else.The episodes she is featured in heavily are boring or infuriating. Most of the season we don't know what the goal is nor is anything explained until the last 5 episodes and then we rush deaths and fights and endings, nothing is satisfying. 
 
The art is the saving grace alot of amazing stills, the animation is ok but alot of cgi pulls it back. 
 
I dragged myself through this wondering should i even finish it and why am i doing this, but the are decent episodes in the middle and Favaro,Rita,Kaisar and Bachus are decent returning caracthers though they are changed and not the focus of the story.So id say you will enjoy something in this anime but just not enough to be worth the watch. 
 
Solid 4. Can watch it but probably should just rewatch the first season

    Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Having watched RoB: Genesis, I was a little sceptical going into RoB: Virgin Soul thinking it might not be able to recreate the feel I had with Genesis, but to my surprise it actually managed to be pretty much on par with Genesis, however just like Genesis, Virgin Soul still has it's own problems. 
 
Story (8/10) 
 
It has been 10 years since the events of Genesis and the story concentrates on a new heroine called Nina Drango, a bounty hunter who came to Anatae to look for work, however her simple life suddenly gets a lot more hectic. 
I think the main problem Genesis had with it's story was the pacing and how it was set out, Virgin Soul felt much more well put together and coordinated better, the story would shuffle along at a good pace introducing new characters while also reintroducing old ones we all loved in the first series. 
There was even a few surprise's along the way that I really wasn't expecting and this does relate to some characters dying, I ain't gonna spoil who, but there are some moments which felt really emotional. 
I also really liked the whole power rivalry between the Gods, Demons and Humans. After being crippled from Bahamut, the Humans are the ones who managed to come out on top and making the Demons their slaves, while the Gods have hidden themselves away waiting for their new saviour to help them bring back the power they once had, throughout the show I was really uncertain who to support, it was mainly the Demons I supported mostly because of the way they are treated, while I disliked the Humans and Gods because of their search for power so they can show who is the strongest. My support went back and forth between the factions and honestly the way they tied it up felt kinda rushed, but it's something I can live with. 
I think there are two things really that didn't seem entirely right with the story, the first being the whole romantic sub-plot between Nina and Charioce, where we have the main heroine and villain fall in love, this didn't click for me, I mean it isn't the worst romance I have seen, but it wasn't one I could support. The reason why Favaro and Amira worked in Genesis is due to their characters working well together, here that doesn't seem to be the case especially when between the two Nina was the likeable while Charioce was pretty much an asshole. 
The second reason is the fact that the final episodes felt a bit like a re-repeat of the final episodes for Genesis, but without some certain things, however this still worked for me and managed to end the series well enough. 
 
Characters (8/10) 
 
The characters in Virgin Soul were done pretty damn well, considering how amazing Favaro was as a character in Genesis alongside a few others, Virgin Soul manages to make the older characters better while also bringing in new characters and making them good too, well mostly. 
The two newest main characters are Nina and Charioce, Nina is basically the new Favaro and to be honest if Favaro didn't show up during this series, having Nina as a stand in for him would've been ok because Nina is a very likeable character, she always has this rush going on and is a highly positive person making her a really fun person, she's also pretty badass in a fight much like Favaro except a little clumsier, however the only downside to her character is the fact that whenever she gets turned on by a good looking guy she turns into a dragon, this did start becoming an issue to me until she managed to control her powers eventually. 
Charioce is the main villain of the series, he's pretty much a douchebag asshole, well when he's king since sometimes he likes to wear a disguise and sneak out which does bring out a softer side to him, but overall I didn't really like his character and aside from one other new character he was pretty much a dislikeable character, though not a shitty one, I didn't want to gouge my eyes out everytime I saw him. 
Mugaro is another character who is brought into this series and he is actually a decent character, though there isn't much to describe about him, he is pretty much the cute factor that makes you like him no matter what really and honestly I'm fine with that. 
Virgin Soul really does the characters from Genesis justice, it manages to make lesser known characters like Azazel, Jeanne, hell even Bacchus and Hamsa are given more time and are built into much more likeable characters by the end as we get to know more about them and some of the stuff that has happened to them after Genesis can make you feel sorry for some of them. 
But when it comes to our main crew Favaro, Kaisar and Rita, the show manages to make them even better, well it definitely makes Rita and Kaisar better as every scene between them just felt funny and nostalgic reminding you of how things were in Genesis, Favaro doesn't appear until a little later on in the series and even then his screentime is lacking a little compared to the others, but I did like the way they developed his character, some might say he isn't as funny anymore, however when you survived against a giant dragon ans lost someone you care about it's going to change you a lot and I liked how they made him as a mentor to Nina which made them two an awesome duo at times. 
 
Art (7/10) 
 
Possible the weakest part of the show is the artstyle, now luckily they managed to keep the feel of the world like it was in Genesis, the big problems are the increased focus on CGI which didn't look good in certain scenes and looked pretty stupid, along with the fact that the series mainly concentrates it's focus in Anatae and it can get a little boring staring at the same buildings and rooftops after a certain amount of episodes. 
Although the other locations were interesting, a complex prison brought out a Temple of Doom feel to it which felt nice, we got to see what a village full of dragonfolk would look like and there was more focus on the Gods homeland, which was pretty damn shiny. 
 
Sound (7/10) 
 
When it came to the op's and ed's it was pretty mixed, but mostly positive.  
The first op was good when it came to the visual's, it fitted the style of the Rage of Bahamut Series, with it's selected red, black, white and gray colours, but the music was a little meh and didn't really get me going until it was about to change. 
The second op pretty much did the opposite where it had good music that gave a heroic tone that really fitted the show, but having a lackluster looking intro which mainly focuses on CGI really. 
The first ed fitted in a way according to Nina's character, while the second ed was actually forgettable. 
 
Extras: 
 
When it came to action, it felt much more spaced out than Genesis, then again Genesis only had 12 episodes whereas Virgin Soul has 24, but the action was pretty damn good my only problems are they either felt short or were just piled on with CGI which didn't help. 
The adventure aspect didn't feel as good either compared to Genesis, even though Genesis felt a lot like LOTR in some way, Virgin Soul just felt like a bunch of stuff happening with the main characters getting caught in the middle of it and have to find a way to get out of it. 
 
Enjoyment (8/10) 
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
Overall Virgin Soul is mostly on par with Genesis, both are good and both have their problems, the after credit scene during the final episode does have me hyped in a way that a third season could happen and might focus on the old crew again, if this is the case then it could be a brilliant way to end the story.

    Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul had more dumb plot points than I can count. Starting from king making himself into an enemy of everyone for no reason whatsoever.  
 
Don't get me started about characters and their useless deaths. So many characters/ deaths have literally 0 impact even though they're supposed to be relevant. 
 
Favaro was literally non existent in this series. Impact wise and overall.  
 
I didn't expect for things to get so dumb and pointless. Doesn't feel satisfying at all. In all honesty I hope that this anime won't be getting a 3rd season. Because it was written so poorly that it makes me question what the fuck and why the fuck.

    The devil plan of invasion continues……. Yeah right! It hasn’t even started yet. Well, if she’s not too distracted with all her much curiosities to almost everything. Still, like Chizuru said that in many ways Ika-chan already invaded their lives. With this sequel, there are more funny and cute moments. It gets more interesting as it gets more dramatic and there’s more touching moments. The jokes and gags are a lot cleaner and nicely done now. The storylines are a lot more sophisticated and interesting now. Well, not that season one was not interesting enough.  
 
The characters are as weird, funny and unique as ever. Though, I absolutely think Sanae’s “hentai” – ness is tripled. After Ika-chan, she’s mostly the source of gags and funny moments with all her perverseness. But of course let’s not forget our extremely cute and irresistible protagonist, Ika Musume-chan. She started off as a weird and annoying stranger but now people that loves and adores her keeps piling up. I think she’s a lot closer with her new found family and friends in the land. They are close enough to have serious bickering and fights. She’s more affectionate and sensitive now. She’s experimental as ever with her naivety to almost everything which is the main source of her cuteness. It is just funny that she’s already used to being in the land and rarely seen in the sea that you end up wondering if she’s really from the sea. I also love that there is more airtime for the extremely cute mini version Ika-chan. Though, I am just a little bit disappointed that there’s not even a single new character as sequels always have to make it somehow really looked like a sequel.  Well, not that it affects the quality of this nice series. I am just expecting another addition to these fun and cute characters. And again, the mysterious character appears once again at the end of the series when they are having dramatic moments again. I just wish they would give even a small hint as to who she is or what she is. 
 
Well, it’s not that long since the last season so there is not much difference. However, I honestly think that though it is not obviously visible, there are still improvements to it. I even think that if in season one Ika-chan is the only cute one and the rest are just nicely done but this time I think most of them are a lot cuter. They can be as adorable as Ika-chan is. And boy did I miss those irresistible blue tentacles! 
 
There is no question that almost all the elements of it really improved. It definitely feels like a sequel. I am absolutely looking forward to more squidy adventure from this fun and nice series.

    I'm just left feeling empty now. I'm kind of bummed that we may never get more of squid girl.  
 
So the second season i can't really say if it's an improvement over the first season. Second season seems to have more shorts stories. While the first season seemed longer. But we do get a lot more creative idea's in this. 
 
I don't like that the Three Stooges or Scientist got even more screen time. I genuinely dislike them and feel they only hamper the shows quality. I still like Cindy. She can be fun by herself.  
 
I also don't like the shy girls dad that makes weird robotic helmets of Squid Girl. First time i found it to be kind of fun but they kept bringing him and his heads back and it got old and annoying real quick.  
 
I kind of wish we got to see Squid Girl going to school with the group of friends she made. I honestly like this part a lot. Her friends are actually nice and don't feel annoyingly hype, pushy or just mean. The group of friends ( Including SG) are a fun group. I'd also love to see SG become the schools mascot within the first couple days. 
 
I do kind of wish we got more of SG's background. I'd love to see SG's mom. I'd imagine she'd be the smartest of the family.  
 
I do think seeing SG grow up more would be interesting. I'd love to see how SG looks when she has the body of whatever age Eiko and Chizuru is. Also wish the story had SG get another Birthday this season.  
 
I do like that they made Chizuru a lot more fun and appealing to have on screen. In the first season she could be kind of annoying with how everyone treats her and how she acted. But in this she is more humanized. 
 
I like the relationship between Eiko and SG. Honestly is nice. Their bickering about each other but how they actually do care for one another. They have some underlining tones of Yuri in this between the two of them. Some is obvious and others you'd have to pay more attention to find. But i'd love that to be the case. They do seem like a good pair.  
 
More of a side note. But i'd love if both Eiko and SG were someplace by alone and SG for what ever reason found the infamous Japanese Tentacle porn even just for a brief gag. Have Eiko then have to explain it. I'd imagine SG would either be horrified , Interested in what's happening or completely obvious to why Eiko is freaking out.  
 
Overall i liked the second season a lot. They expanded on characters and made them a lot more fun to have on screen and we also got more Eiko and SG.

    The invader returns for a second season. What I'd call a surprise hit from late 2010 was not going to go unnoticed this time around, it had a lot to squid up to.  
 
If you've seen season one (which I'm assuming you have), season 2 is exactly the same. There is absolutely no plot outside of Ika Musume came from the sea to invade the Earth for polluting the ocean and is now working at a beach shack.  
 
All the characters from last time are back too, and pretty much the same. Eiko still has a tsundere relationship with Ika Musume, Chizuru is still scary, Sanae is still in love with her, Nagisa is still scared, Cyndi and the three stooges still want to run experiments, etc. Kiyomi also returns with some side characters, who get no development, but are there to show Ika Musume made friends.  
 
Like S1 there are some Mini-Ika segments too. While they are kawaii to the core, they do feel kinda out of place.  
 
As far as quality of the episodes (each one has about 2-3 mini parts like in S1) there are a few that are better than the ones in S1, but in my opinion, a lot of them missed the mark. Don't get me wrong, they are still enjoyable, and funny, but they just aren't as funny for some reason. It's really one of those things you can't judge unless you've seen both. 
 
While I normally don't go into the music, I do have complaints about the OP. It's just so... un Ika Musume like. The original OP was great, it was about invasion and really fit the show. This time around it's just... nice. The ED is pretty good though, like last time it's basically Ika (this time walking) and a stillish scene, but that changes based on what happened in an episode. 
 
Overall I'd say Ika Musume S2 is an enjoyable anime that will keep a smile on your face, but failed to meet the charm that S1 delivered.

    Inkvasion sorta kinda suckcessful somewhat to a certain extent... 
 
Whilst FUNi was waiting for Geneon so they can get their DVD+BD combos (as well as releasing fanservicy animu that feature ""herbivore shounen""), Media Blasters (along with the non-""Poof Sputter"" arm of Bang Zoom) managed to release season 1 onto DVD here pretty quickly. 
 
Kraken-chan Season 2 is more of the same, unfortunately. There's nothing new about this animu. 
 
* Chizuru is STILL an undefeatable Mary-Sue. 
* Goro becomes her punching bag. Literally. 
* Ayumi now falls into the ""I can beat a guy up"" category. 
 
If this series wasn't so charming and endearing, I would've set it near the lot of other animu and cleaned it with fire. 
 
But all in all... To the people who complain about the wack time slots they get on TV and cable: Remember that televangelists and salespeople also use these time slots. THERE'S A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR IT. The lot of people don't like when others shove their ideologies and such down their throats. Moe and fanservice can only take something so far.

    Shinryaku!? Ika Musume is the second season of the Ika Musume or Squid Girl franchise –a highly risible anime series about an adorable and bumbling anthropomorphic squid christened Ika Musume (unimaginative name, eh?) who originally intended to invade the surface to punish the filthy and callous human race for polluting the ocean. 
 
Unfortunately, a high school girl (albeit with superhuman powers) trounces Ika in her first battle, which quickly puts an end to the underwater threat to human civilization. Of course, this hardly dissuades Ika Musume (because she is a numbskull) who ardently continues to pursue her quixotic idée fixe and concocts outlandish schemes, by the bushel, to conquer the world, all of which result in her being hoist on her own petard, in hilarious fashion. 
 
Over the course of the series, Ika Musume also meets an eclectic and eccentric cast of characters, which include a crazy teen girl called Sanae (the second best character of the series) who desperately wants to test if love (and a lot more) can flourish between two species; a bodacious and brainy American-cum-MIT graduate-cum-alien hunter-cum-bikini babe named Cindy, who wants to dissect her (and yes, I am probably insinuating something by repeatedly using that word; are you sagacious enough to guess what?); and many other less remarkable ones. As the story is in episodic format, it primarily depends on Ika’s interactions with the characters for humor. 
 
The second season continues in the much the same vein and introduces a few new side characters; albeit completely unmemorable ones. Unfortunately, for a show that is completely character driven, the second season has little to no character development and I quickly got bored of the shticks and quirks of the side characters. However, this did not dissuade me much, as the piece de resistance of the show –Ika Musume, retained her ineffable and inimitable charm that made me like the show so much in the first place. I think that it has to do with the fact that I really adore gamines like Ika (only in anime) because they evoke wistful memories of my vivacious and mischievous 9-year old sister –who stays 2,000 KMs away from me with my parents. 
 
Still, there is only so much that one outstanding character can do for a poor show and by the penultimate episode, my interest was flagging considerably and I was certain that the show would end up with a rating of 4. Thankfully, the last episode turned out to be an absolute gem, wrapped up the season in spectacular fashion, and tugged a few heartstrings as well, which made me reconsider my decision and resulted in the score being bumped up to 5. 
 
As for the audio-visuals, I thought that the show could have been better animated and I did not like most of the character designs–with the notable exception of Ika Musume. The voice acting was mediocre overall, although I think that Ika’s seiyuu did her job consummately. 
 
As for the OP and ED, the former is fast-paced and ebullient while the latter is slower and beautifully expresses the bonds that Ika shares with her human counterparts; I really enjoyed both. 
 
To sum it all up, I felt that the second season of Ika Musume is more or less a rehash of the previous season and gets boring very soon; so, I would only recommend loyal and devoted fans of Ika-Chan (like myself) to watch this season; others can skip it or can watch the only last episode, if they wish.

    Here we go again! 
 
The second season of Shinryaku!? Ika Musume is very much like the first season however with some changes here and there, for one, no more new characters are permanently added to the cast, it's the same cast we know with all their running gags only amplified. 
 
For one, Cyndi and the Three stooges' invention gets ramped up into more bizarre inventions that utterly don't help the situation in their venture to make Ika Musume their test subject, Sanae's obsession with Ika Musume is amped up as well with her obsession going into masochist mild yandere states at times. 
 
Once again many of Ika Musume's ventures are like making the more mundane things humans go through making Ika Musume seem to make it intense and awesome in alot of ways. 
 
We do in this season get some mild character development (if LA can call it that) to some characters in this season such as Chizuru (still LA's favourite character in the series) showing off her more emotional side as well as showing off some of her weaknesses due to her being Ika Musume's biggest obstacle in her invasion in the first place. Ika Musume shows off some more of her new powers, showed development of showing that not ALL humans are bad which culminated into getting an emotional moment in the finale with Eiko showing that even though Eiko is Ika Musume's biggest minder (and the tsukommi to Ika's boku) she still somewhat cares about Ika Musume as harsh as she is to her. Some minor characters like Kiyomi gets expanded upon as well what with Kiyomi's click getting added to the cast but only as something of a satellite characters to Kiyomi. 
 
So essentially Shinryaku!? Ika Musume is just many of Ika Musume's daily lives with even goofier and wackier scenario's for her to be put in, that and the ""flavour"" of the first season of Ika Musume is still in this second season, by not only showing off Ika Musume's daily life and all but defying expectations to MANY of skits LA mentioned above. 
 
Ika Musume's humor comes from one situation that leads into another THEN having our expectations of Ika Musume winning or the outcome but then ONE factor screws/changes the outcome of Ika Musume (or the character in focus) that allows Ika Musume to be put back to square one. Now this is saying the status quo is in place for the most part and in this season LA thinks it got the brunt of it due to the no follow through besides those setup in the first season. Now is LA saying the humor isn't the same as the first season due to this, no, it's just the factor of isolated incidents of Ika Musume going through the motions and even if the status quo is in place, LA got a chuckle from a couple of skits in this season if not because of how much crazier or unexpected the result DID become be it if LA knows the outcome or not. 
 
Unexpectedness is key for Shinryaku!? Ika Musume and it nailed it even in this season. 
 
In terms of animation once again done by diomedea, the character designs and backgrounding is through and through the same as the first season...really not much too talk about the animation besides the rare times of art style changes for exaggerated reactions and everything but the animation is the same as the first verse just consistent.  
 
The voice acting is again the same as the first season, the only annoyance LA actually found this season happen to be Kanae Ito as Sanae, nothing on the voice actor on this one as Sanae's obsession peaked this season so she's even more obnoxiously annoying compared to her first season portrayal. Hisako Kanemoto doing her squid-esque accenting is consistent as ever and Rie Tanaka as Chizuru is her typical caring older sister but DON'T F*** WITH HER vocals as well. There are some actually decent ""English"" in this anime dubbed by Sarah Hauser for both Cyndi and Ika's English...it was more or less uncanny hearing that. But yeah..same as the animation, the voice acting is consistent at best. 
 
Shinryaku!? Ika Musume's second season is going through the motions of Ika Musume's daily life, trying to invade the world but failing time and again, however what Ika Musume fails to realize is all the time she's spent with Eiko, Chizuru, Takeru, Cyndi, Sanae and Kiyomi and everyone else, sure she hasn't invaded the world but she has ""invaded"" and oddly enough helped all the people she's encountered to be together and if it wasn't for Ika Musume, they would have never meet the people that they did. ""Invasion"" is a strong word, more like ""friendship"" at best and that is what Ika Musume is to everyone by the end of it, the hilarity, craziness or mundanity of it all. 
 
Nonetheless Shinryaku!? Ika Musume was a nice wrap up to the Ika Musume series even for a status quo rather unpredictable skit based comedy anime about a humanoid squid girl wanting to take over the world.

    After a year of absence, Ika Musume returns once again to invade the anime world, bringing along with her all the gags and skits of the first season back for another run. For those who have watched season one of Ika Musume, this is definitely a must-watch. But even for those who haven't watched season one, you won't be missing anything if you jump right into the second season. All you need to know is that there's a squid girl ""attempting"" to invade the land. Shinryaku!? Ika Musume is essentially the exact replica of the first season except with different stories so don't go into it expecting something totally brand-new. So, let's begin the review ~de geso.  
 
Art (7/10) 
The artwork for the show has always been simple but good. The characters and backgrounds generally look lively, with the designs taking a more comedic style once in a while. It's nothing to cheer about but it's watchable and does what it's supposed to do.  
 
Characters (7/10) 
Surprisingly, there weren't any new (and notable) characters this season. Even though I was glad that the entire cast from season one returned, I can't say I wasn't disappointed at the lack of new faces. The characters have barely changed - Ika Musume is still the center of attention and comedy, Chizuru is still extremely creepy when she's mad, Sanae is still obsessed with Ika Musume, etc. I guess the idea of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was in the mind of the mangaka as he continued Ika Musume after realizing it was successful.  
 
Sound (8/10) 
Like last season, Ika Musume opens with a fast-paced and upbeat OP that readies one for the comedy in next twenty or so minutes while the slower and softer ED wraps up the episode. I personally liked both songs, with the OP slightly getting the edge over the ED. As expected, the same BGM and seiyū from season one return for season two. Not many changes to note in this category.  
 
Story (6/10) 
While the first season was generally plotless, I was more forgiving considering that the series was still new to me. However, with the second season now finished, I'm starting to wonder if the original premise of Ika Musume invading the land has been completely forgotten. It's actually not the lack of plot that bothered me this season, but how unfitting the show's title is. Sure, maybe the question mark is there to hint that the invasion may not happen after all, but I'm still quite confused as to why the word ""Shinryaku"" is even there in the first place. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the three skits (or ""stories"", if you prefer) in each episode. They were generally entertaining and amusing.  
 
Overall (7/10) 
To be honest, the second season of Ika Musume didn't live up to the first season. I think it's the repetitiveness of it all that made it lose its charm. Still, that is not to say it was bad in any way. In fact, I am slightly looking forward to a third season, though I have a few doubts here and there. And with that, we bid farewell to squid girl once again and wait to see if she'll appear again next year.

    Ok, so what we have here is a season 2 of the original ""Shinryaku? Ika Masume,"" so far it still maintains the same kind of plotless slapstick comedy genre, were every episode is compose of a couple of omake. And as usual the squid girl still hasn't successfully conquered the surface world and she's still working on it, degeso. 
 
So how does this season 2 fare up, degeso? 
 
Let's see, degeso: 
 
Story- fair number 6, degeso. 
 
Ok so according to one of the commentators from the form, this anime still focuses on a couple omakes which for every episode would either hit or misses ones funny bone  and she right, there are certain instances that you'll feel irritated with Ika chan. But then again the slapstick comedy genre makes up for it, degeso. 
 
Art-mediocre number 5, degeso. 
 
It's very obvious, that the art used from the previous season is still the same for this season, degeso. 
 
Sound - poor number 3, degeso. 
 
I simply hate both opening and ending themes. 
 
Characters- mediocre number 5, degeso. 
 
Well, isn't it very obvious that the same main characters are still there and nothing much has change regarding their roles, there may some additional characters in this anime but then again they're merely support roles that adds to the content of this anime. Oh, I kinda like to see Cindy just in her striped bikini without the red jacket and I still find Sanae very funny being kicked in the butt by Ika chan's tentacles, degasso. 
 
Enjoyment and overall- fair number 6, degeso. 
 
Well I'd probably say that even if the omakes in each episode is either a hit or a miss, I'd say that everything does hit in a comic sense, so I don't mind getting pissed at Ika's stupidly as long as she provides the laughs. How will this anime ends? I guess it's very obvious that she still gonna be working for the sisters as one of their waitresses, she still gonna keep working on her plans to conquer the surface world, and possibly become a human, as it did from the previous episode, then again, I'm just guessing. By the way if there's is another thing that has change is anime is that she can fly.......or float in the air since she can alter her weight with the help of her magic bracelets, degeso.

    Gentlemen, the new second season of the most addicting shit ever made is finally here. 
 
Ika Musume is back! After a year-long time since it has started airing in October 2010 (9 months  break since it has finished airing in December 2010) we finally get a new season a couple of days before October 2011, before the new Fall 2011 anime season starts.  
 
And this time, Ika-Musume is more ADORABLE and BADASS than ever. 
 
Story: 10 
The story is extremely simple yet shows some layers of unheard complexity. The most ADORABLE and BADASS humanoid squid creature of the bright blue sea comes to shore to invade humanity yet she is 1000 years too young to actually do this particular invasion so instead she spends her time with two Hoes named Chizuru and that Orange haired girl who nobody cares about. Oh yeah, and some other characters thrown in the mix also. All the story occurs near the sea side and shows the lives of the Bland characters along with the most ADORABLE and BADASS Ika Musume. All the other characters support her overflowing Sex Appeal. 
 
What is complex about the story you ask? If a story contains the most ADORABLE and BADASS Squid humanoid creature that comes from the sea it has automatically become complex beyond words. 
 
Every episode of the first season and the new first episode of the second season shows amazingly complex and splendid writing (following the manga from tooth to nail). The staff that works on this anime knows what he is doing. 
 
Each episode is split into 3 parts of 3 short stories, and fuck, every part is better than his predecessor. The stories are simply stunning! 
 
The story flows so naturally because of the character of the most ADORABLE and BADASS Ika Musume. Without her, the story won't move. She is an essential piece in this ""game"", like a ""KING"" or a ""QUEEN"" in chess. 
 
She is the core of the story. 
 
Art: 10 
The animation studio reprises the art of the first season with some fluid new additions. The art never looked so crisp and beautiful and the sea-side scenery is simply breathtaking. 
And you know, without the good art you can't make a story so believable because the animation breaths life into the characters, and especially to the most ADORABLE and BADASS Ika Musume. Most of the care of the animation goes into animating her antics: There is alot of animation job to do because of her, and mainly because of her tentacles. 
 
Sound:10 
TWO WORDS: Kanemoto Hisako. 
 
FIFTEEN WORDS: One of the best voice acting jobs that fits the character like a condom to a penis. 
 
Aside from that the music and voice acting are great. The new OP and ED never before sounded so fresh and the animation in them fits in today's standards. 
 
The sound effects are also believable. 
 
Character: 10 
Like I said before, Ika Musume is the core of the story. All the story revolves her, and without her I would not give the characters a full 10. Her presence is what makes the anime to what it is. 
 
Other mildly notable supporting characters are Sanae the lesbian stalker that is gay for Ika Musume, and Chizuru, who is extremely frightening at times. There are some many other characters showing up at times, but they are not very important for the story. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
TBH, this is the most enjoyable show I've ever seen, and I have seen many. This show stands out from other shows that I have seen because of the comedy and the most ADORABLE and BADASS Ika Musume who is the new Jesus (Well... for me that is, no offense for religious people). The existence of Ika is what keeps my life moving. Yes, she is THAT important for me. She will be always more important than my future wife, she is my TRUE WAIFU!!!!!! (Don't tell that to my future wife though) 
 
Overall: 10 
 
ADORABLE. BADASS. ADDICTING. 10/10 across all the board!

    I'm not as much of a Final Fantasy fan as some others are but I've played my share of titles from the series and I am already horribly hooked on Final Fantasy 15. 
 
That being said, I do NOT understand some people complaining about the characters, story and whatsoever. 
I know mostly everything there is to know about the game at this moment but I've even watched Kingsglaive a 2nd time, this time with my brother who knows absolutely NOTHING about the game and he still understood everything that was going on. 
 
There are many people who get one thing completely WRONG! 
Kingsglaive does NOT play as a PREQUEL to the game but more MEANWHILE. Kingslgaive shows what is happening around the (possibly beginning) of the game. 
 
The characters had personality, which can't be said about many characters in anime history or even video game history. Most of them acted in a way that was mostly realistic, it would be unrealistic and quite boring if every characters would do the absolute right thing at all time, right? Luna was a tiny bit annoying at some parts but nothing that would lower my rating for the movie at all. 
 
Some people said they had problems following the camera when there's a combat scene. I had no problem with that at all. The overall pace of the movie was quite satisfying for me. 
 
Overall, the story was explained fully so that everyone should understand it. Characters were really enjoyable and likable. Soundtracks were amazing and the graphics, gods the GRAPHICS. 
 
I'm not saying Kingsglaive is perfect. No. But it was an amazing and epic movie to watch.

    Before watching Kingsglaive, if you've never followed the developments of FFXV I suggest you do a little research first about the characters and the story line. This is a prequel of the game so this is important.  
 
STORY >>> The story, I say is quite good. Of course this doesn't shine away from crystals or the typical final fantasy themes of recent years but this has it's own charms and flair. There are a couple of scenes with cheesy lines (kind of, imo) but can be ignored. And the plot has its surprises.  
 
ART >>> WOW! It's fantastic graphics, and shows how much the FF series has evolved. 
 
SOUND >>> Nothing grandiose here but the sounds fits the scenes. 
 
CHARACTER >>> The characters are nice and for mostly an action packed film there's character development for the main cast. 
 
ENJOYMENT >>> Really enjoyed it and would recommend it to FF fans (or to non FF followers/fans, again just do a little research first otherwise you'd end up lost).

    Note: I wrote this review a few months after I saw it. I can't be bothered to watch it again but, I felt like my opinion on it was worth sharing. I try not to go into plot too much for people who are just looking for a general review without spoiling anything so I hope y'all have a good read and that I (somehow) Convince you to watch or not watch this movie.  
 
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV 
 
The Story:  
So the story takes place right after Noctis leaves. The only thing you really get from it in the game is that shit went down in the city and the movie shows what happened in the city while Noctis and the boy band were off on their magical boy adventure. Without spoiling a quick summary would be that the main character is in the Kingsglaive a group of people that protects the Crown City and the King it follows Nyx Ulric as he goes through the Niflheim army's invasion in the Crown City   
 
Art: 
Kingsglaive should be seen as a really long Final Fantasy CGI Cutscene. And honestly it looks really good. It never really reaches the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children final battle level but it does have some pretty great action sequences.  
 
Sound:  
All I can say is the music is good and the voice acting for the most part is pretty good aswell so I guess it can have that.  
 
Characters:  
There are like 3 major characters in this movie so ill give a brief summary of all of them. 
 
King Regis Lucis Caelum: King Regis is the current king of Lucis, he has very strong magic abilities and gets introduced an honourable man and a caring father, He uses the Ring of the Lucii to channel the power of Insomnia's Crystal. With that power he maintains the Wall. 
 
Lunafreya Nox Fleuret: There's nothing to say about Lunfreya in this movie. I guess the enemy in the movie are trying to kidnap her (It's pretty vague about what exactly they are trying to do with her) and that's kind of it you see her dealing with the city being demolished and how incredible shocked she is by the events that happen inside the city (I mean that ironically she doesn't have any real emotion she is the only one who's acting I don't like, Lena Headey is a good actress but her performance in this film isn't good, I wouldn't say bad just not good I like the game's Lunafreya's performance more.)  I never felt that she was actually well written or doing something noteable in the movie.  
 
Nyx Ulric: The main protagonist of the movie. Let's get acting out of the way first Aaron Paul did a pretty good voice performance and didn't dissapoint me in this movie. Nyx got saved as a child by King Regis, to repay him he serves in the Kingsglaive. Nyx is also the only character that keeps your intrest in the movie. He's a pretty alright character and seems to be the only one who's able to make wise decisions in the film. 
 
There are more people to talk about but these are the 3 characters I felt I could give a good description off without spoiling anything.  
 
Overall 
 
For me this film is a very mixed bag. On a technical level it looks and sounds fantastic, but the story is goddamn awful it makes sense but it's bland and really some of the things the characters do go right against how the movie seems to want the characters to act. But the action sequences and the presence of Nyx Ulric actually being pretty good I can't say it's good nor bad. I watched this before playing Final Fantasy XV and I think the only way you would enjoy this film is if you are planning to play or have played Final Fantasy XV. It's kind of the same problem Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children had (But Advent Children was better and actually felt like a good return to form for Cloud and Co while this movie will never give you the same epic feeling as that movie did) 
I give it a 6 because while it isn't a good movie at all ,like really just avoid it if you don't like Final Fantasy, it is a fun preview of the world you will be spending your time in in the game and nothing more then that.

    I am not really familiar with the plot of Final Fantasy XV, nor did I have any particular expactations about this movie - I watched it pretty much on a whim, but I don't coonsider it a time wasted. While it lacked a lot of things - the lip sync was off, there were a few too many loopholes and unexplained plot developments, and the story WAS fairly simple. Even taking all this into consideration, it was rather fun and engaging watching this. I liked both the animation and the music. The action sequences were entertaining, but a bit chaotic, and it was sometimes a bit difficult to tell what's going on(altough I guess that's usually the case with action sequences). This is far from a must-watch, but I can't help but disagree with people that give this movie the lowest of scores, because while it has many shortcomings, somehow, magically, it's still enjoyable to see.

    This review contains some spoilers. 
 
I think that first of all, as a Final Fantasy fan, I have to say that this is the movie worst adaptated for this universe. I'm not saying that this makes it a bad movie, not at all, but only I wanted to clarify that. Advent Children and The Spirits Within were much more of a Final Fantasy than this one.  
 
Kingsglaive is not a bad movie per se, but it doesn't highlight in anything. Of course, technical section is impressive and impeccable: characters (even if Nyx isn't that well drawn), lights, places... This all is made with perfection so the movie can really be enjoyed.  
 
We have a movie that is divided in three acts: the first one is quite mediocre, as the script is capricious and the structure directly amorphous. We have two kingdoms fighting between each other and the presentation of some characters that are living this. About Nyx, character of Final Fantasy XV, we only know something about him (and see him) at the start (and after the credits) of the movie, and I'm not complaining about this either: I only expose it.  
 
But about Lunafreya, also character of Final Fantasy XV, we know many other things, as she is protagonist alongside Nyx Ulric, a member of the Kingsglaive (Guards of the King), and King Regis, Nyx's father. I do not think that the characters of the film are bad at all: Nyx and Lunafreya are, in my opinion, a bit wasted, and leave Regis as, by far, the best thing of this movie, as he is the only one to really be natural, to really be a character and to breath as one.  
 
As I was saying, the first act is bad, but the second one gets really incredible. The tension that we feel and experience as the movie goes on remembers me about Game of Thrones, specially in the scene where Regis and Iedolas are simply talking. In that moment, we have Nyx fighting to save Lunafreya from General Glauca and an opening of scene very impressive, composed by a certain number of different cameras coming from left and right to the center of the screen. I think that this block of the film in particular, adding the duel in the palace, is very well made (not because of the plot, because we arrive at this point just ""because"", but because of how it is done on-screen).  
 
Nevertheless, the third act is really shameful: it's a constant block of fighting and it seems to never end. I can accept the part of Nyx being the chosen to put the ring and to use its powers; I can accept General Glauca being the leader of the Kingsglaive; and I can also say that I seriously liked the ending scene of Nyx, when the sun sets and he dies peaceful and romantically. What I can't accept is seeing big statues fighting and destroying Insomnia. That is only spectacle with no good reason.  
 
So, is Kingsglaive a good movie? I can certainly say that it is not a bad one, and that is has some interesting ideas, but Nozue, our ""dear"" director of this movie, didn't know how to use them. Anyway, I think it is worth watching.

    (Review originally posted on Letterboxd) 
 
This movie tried really, really hard to be something special, something more than a tie-in prologue to a video game, and it got fairly close, but its execution was unfortunately not as good as its ambition. 
 
This movie, essentially the Rogue One to the recent video game Final Fantasy XV, is the story of some guardsmen as they deal with the impending collapse of their kingdom after a really long war. The movie opens with a fairly incomprehensible opening monologue and throws us right into the action with pretty much no explanation afterwards. Anyone who complained about Warcraft being hard to follow needs to watch this and see just how hard it COULD have been; I was thoroughly baffled for the first fifteen minutes at least. Though... I started to dig it eventually, thanks in part to the well-crafted worldbuilding. 
 
There's a lot to praise about the movie technically. The CGI is several steps above other recent Japanese-animated movies such as Space Captain Harlock, and the movie was specially re-animated for the English version, so the lips move in-sync, which really surprised me at first. The world of Final Fantasy XV is also intricately-designed, and you can tell that in every scene from the beautiful sets and costumes (can I use those terms for CGI movies?). It's a sign that, even without motion-capture performances, computer animation is coming a long way and it's going to look superb in just a few years. 
 
The story is also wrapped up in ambition; there's a big political plot and a whole lot of machinations and it's genuinely compelling to a degree. However, the execution is pretty poor in some areas; there's one subplot that seems really minor, disappears, and then becomes very important, but in a confusing way. The entire main plot is also incredibly convoluted. It's unfortunate, but it's not incredibly difficult to follow unless you already gave up by that point. 
 
Some of the action setpieces are genuinely amazing; the final battle has a dual-battle that plays with scale in ways that I had never thought about from any action movie. And some of them are just storyboarded really-well. However, the editing for these sequences is oftentimes strange and makes them hard to follow. The opening battle sequence is actually the worst example, which is probably what left me so confused for so long into the movie's first act. 
 
Also, because I watched the English dub, I got some pretty mediocre voice acting from the non-principal cast, with a lot of annoying anime voices. Aaron Paul is good, though. The sound editing for the voice acting is also damn bad, making it sound like, well, a dub. The voices usually sound like they're coming from disembodied sources offscreen rather from the characters speaking. It's not always the case, though, so I know they could have done better. 
 
Overall I can't help but have enjoyed the movie; it's ridiculously complicated, very self-serious, and pretty dorky, with a ton of narrative flaws, but it's entertaining enough that I can give it the benefit of the doubt. A lot like Jupiter Ascending, actually. I doubt I will ever play Final Fantasy XV, but this movie did make me very interested in it, at least.

    When Final fantasy comes to mind, I can think only of killing monsters as I have played a few of the games and enjoyed them. However when it comes to this movie, that really isn't the case(mostly). 
 
Story:6 
The story itself was pretty basic. Lucis and the Niflheim empire have been at war for years. A magical crystal that protects Lucis manages to keep the empire out.  Niflheim manages to break in but the Kingsglaive(The military taskforce)are there to stop them. 
 
Characters:6 
The characters too me didn't really stand out much. The majority of them didn't get much screen time so it's kind of understandable. The one that did get most of the screen time was Nyx. He was a total badass and voiced by the one and only Aaron Paul(if you watched the dubbed). 
 
Sound:10 
This is one of the movies strong points. The music that is played throughout is always on at the right time and goes along with what is occurring. The sound effects that come from the cars, swords clashing and everything else is top notch. The voice acting was great too. 
 
Art/Animation:9 
When it comes to the animation, it was almost flawless. Some of the fight scenes were a little messy and were kind of hard to keep up with. Though they were still enjoyable. Some face movements were kind of off. The art however was phenomenal. Throughout the movie I was forgetting that I was watching an anime because it was so realistic.  
 
Overall:8 
Even though the story and characters were kind of basic, the art and sound were fantastic. The action scenes is what made me hooked throughout the entirety of this movie and just made me wanting more. If you are into action and drama with stunning visuals, i'd give this movie a chance. Id recommend watching this dubbed because since there is so much to look at, the subs would just get in the way and distract you from this gorgeous movie.

    Rating Kingsglaive is somewhat a matter of perspective. Square Enix may sell it as a movie, but that's not really what it is: It's first and foremost a two-hour long prologue for Final Fantasy XV. So if you don't plan on playing the game, Kingsglaive won't really be worth your time, because as a standalone it simply doesn't have enough to offer.  
 
However, should you feel the need to play the game it is a nice addition, as long as you don't think about the plot (and its holes) too hard. Especially since Square Enix seems to assume you saw the movie at the beginning of FF XV. 
 
Compared to its companion Brotherhood, which focuses mostly on the games protagonists, Kingsglaive sheds light on the political backgrounds and the major events that went on prior to the game. Of the two Brotherhood is actually more successful in capturing the games overall atmosphere and its theme of companionship. Kingsglaive mainly bets on its amazing visuals and fast-paced action scenes, attempting to overshadow Square Enix's try to squeeze in as many plotpoints as the two-hour runtime allows.  
 
This overload of different story-parts is ultimately the movies' biggest issue. Not the overall ideas are bad, and yes it's nice that most characters get at least somewhat of a background, but in the end some stuff could have been cut and in return other parts could have been emphasized further. You get the overall feeling that there were simply a lot of things they had and wanted to tell, even though not everything was necessary.   
 
The protagonist Nyx does a fine job as a main character, though he is also quite bland at the same time; he is more or less a very typical hero, without any real edges or flaws and behaves exactly how you'd expect him to. However, I think it should be mentioned that he seems to be quite popular in the fanbase. Aside from him characters like Lunafreya or King Regis get a bigger spotlight in the movie; which is good since they are not all too present in the game despite being pretty essential to the plot. Sadly they remain quite characterless too, just like the rest of the cast.  
 
Probably the movies' biggest asset is its superb animation: it looks absolutely stunning and shows what has become possible with CG-animation by now. Compared to most other CG-movies which tend to use a very cartoonish style, Kingsglaive features (relatively) realistic faces and settings.  
 
Kingsglaives soundtrack is quite extensive, but at same time rather forgettable. It certainly serves its purpose, but most tracks are more or less generic orchestral pieces that don't really stand out.  
 
I'd recommend Kingsglaive only to those who play or plan on playing FF XV or those who like to be entertained by the eye-candy the movie undoubtedly is. To me it was a little-better-than-average experience...and I'm a big Final Fantasy fan.

    First of all the CGI is amazing, for the most part.  There are some motion issues that make things seem a bit unnatural.  There is plenty of Final Fantasy fighting spirit in this movie, but aside from that, not much to be desired.  More could have definitely been done. 
 
Story 6/10 
The movie gives background to the fall of Lucius, with the main plot element the deployment of the KingsGlaive to protect Insomnia.  It's hard to get attached to the characters because all the background they have is being the king's personal elite.  That's it.  They hardly have any family relations, social relations, people they want to protect that are part of the story. 
 
Art 10/10 
Simply put, I don't think there's better CGI out there.  This goes above and beyond Advent Children by a long shot.  The main issue is a bit of unnatural motion with physics(bodies being thrown, and motion blur acting unnaturally).  Advent Children actually does motion a bit better IMO, although that may be because of more pronounced special moves, as well as better choreography.  
 
Sound 7/10 
Some lipsyncing issues as well as the fact that it doesn't have as good of a soundtrack as FFXV.  It's obvious it's not Yoko Shimomura right off the bat. 
 
Characters 7/10 
Characters are likeable and the Glaive seems to have a good relation.  The problem is they're a bit stock and don't have good relations outside of the Glaive.  Because of this it plays out like a generic action movie, with a FF coat. 
 
Enjoyment 6/10 
It's obvious there's room for improvement, whether it be Noctis's relationship with Luna, or the Glaive's life outside of battle.  Some scenery seems forced just to continue the action sequence, even moreso than AC. 
 
Overall 6/10 
Good enough for a watch if you want the backstory.  Not good enough to rewatch.  Go in expecting nothing, because the story definitely doesn't match the graphics.  As a prequel to FFXV I can see some potential with the game, as well as wasted potential with the movie.

    Final Fantasy's developed a bit of a problem. Their stories were always quite simple, with evil empires, noble rebels, wizards, demi-god opponents, and monsters. Their strengths were the way they combined them to create emotional plots and unique characters. The problem with the recent installments is that they've buckled down on the exceedingly basic nature of their plots while dramatically increasing the complexity of their descriptions. While previous installments would be content to simply state that people are using a mana cannon, for example, its abilities to be demonstrated in game, more modern ones would feel compelled to describe the nature of the mana cannon, the means by which it draws its power, the construction of it, the strength of its blasts, some metaphysical conundrums raised by it, etc. And of course, they'd be sure to give it a unique and complicated name that you need to remember for later. Worse still, they might create all these details and then not explain them, leaving the audience to figure these things out on their own or requiring them to read the copious compendium. That might sound like exactly what I'm praising the early games for, but the difference is that everyone can work out what it means when they say a mana cannon is firing but it's a lot harder to understand what is meant when an el'Hurpaderp cannon is vlerping. The added details and terminology add nothing and makes everything more confusing. For example here, when the hero fights the villain he does so in league with a giant monster of some kind whose fight seems to echo his fight. What is this thing? Is he controlling it? Is it simply reflecting his actions? Why does his opponent have one too? Are they the same thing? And why couldn't they simply leave it at two guys fighting without confusing everything by adding in giant monsters that serve no purpose? 
 
And so we come to this movie. It's not the worst example of Final Fantasy's weird terminology (it does at least call a magic wall a magic wall) but it's certainly fallen for the trap of overcomplicating simple matters. The basic plot is admirably simple. An evil empire is assaulting the good people of Lucis but they offer a treaty which could end the war at the expense of surrendering the territory outside their capital of Insomnia. The kingsglaive (a military unit filled by people from outside the city, though why the city-dwellers can't fight for themselves isn't clear) is understandably upset over this since that means that their homes are now outside the kingdom they were protecting. Shenanigans ensue, the evil empire is evil, and fin. There should be enough there to fill a movie. But they are so afraid of meaningful or measured expositing (as opposed to shouting out a lot of complicated phrases meaning nothing) that none of this is allowed to be introduced naturally instead of through shouted cries in between battle scenes. And so much that we need to understand is never explained. Who the heck is this Princess Luna and why is she so important? Why is rescuing her from the empire the king's main issue when his entire kingdom is at stake and when the empire was the one to bring her there as bride to the prince in the first place? Why is Prince Noctis so important to the safety of the world and to Luna personally when they've apparently not seen each other in twelve years? These are not minor unresolved questions that can be swept under the rug as cool mysteries to be uncovered later. They inform every decision made in the film and yet we're never allowed to understand the reason behind the characters' behaviour. The core of the second half of the film is Luna's rescue and escape yet we understand none of why this is happening. All that we know is that people are doing things because other people told them to and oh look at the pretty fight scenes. 
 
A part of this is not the film's fault. The film is the companion to the game and as such has to leave out large parts of exposition which is saved for that story. For that reason it shares many faults with Advent Children. But that cannot excuse the way they chose to go about telling this story. If Luna's backstory can't be explained then leave her out of it. Or if that's not possible have one of the game characters (like King Regis) tell Nyx (the movie exclusive lead) that there are powerful secrets here that he cannot reveal to him. Build up a sense of mystery rather than just ignorance. Nyx isn't a lead in the game so what he knows and doesn't know can serve as the audience's surrogate in the film. It doesn't. There's never a real sense of why things are happening, simply a progression from one fight scene to the next. Characters are nonexistent. Nyx is an empty sack made worse by astonishingly bad voice acting from Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul. The man just does not care about any of this. Sean Bean as King Regis and Lena Hedley as Princess Luna (finally a good Cersei) round out the cast and do slightly better, but there's never any real soul to them. I attribute this to the fact that their motivations and behavior are inscrutable due to the aforementioned absence of meaningful exposition. This is especially unfortunate seeing how good the character work in the companion anime Brotherhood was. None of the characters was exactly deep, but they were distinct and had genuine relationships with each other and their world. Here I can't describe a single character trait beyond a description of their jobs. Nyx is, like, a soldier? He fights people I guess. And monster things. Luna's a princess who cares about something larger than herself? I don't know what that something is because they never tell us. Regis is king and he's, like, nice I think? Probably? It's all a vacuous waste made to service the ""plot"", by which I mean set up cool-looking fight scenes. 
 
As a pretty display of animation the film does alright. The visuals are stunning if so overblown as to be wearing. And the fight scenes with the teleporting swords are pretty damn cool. As a trailer for the world of the game I suppose the film can be tolerated. I know more now than I did before, but at the same time I'm confused and worried that this will be another XIII since all that game's faults are on display bar the endless corridor. That said, Final Fantasy has never adapted well to film and this one is really no worse than Advent Children except for the fact that we went into that one knowing who those characters were. A bad film does not a bad game make, and even if it did the fact that Brotherhood is really quite good gives me some hope that the game is taking a more character-driven approach. I suppose that this film can't really be judged in the absence of the game. It's possible that once the game reveals all this movie will make sense and stand on its own. But I really really doubt it.

    ***This is going to be a spoiler free review...*** 
 
 
Okay, so I am just going to say right from the beginning that I am not a fan of Final Fantasy video game franchise, not because I hate it or anything but because I didn't play any game from the series, but I plan to, though. So, this review will be based solely on what I've seen in this movie. Let's get started! 
 
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is an outstandingly animated film which at some points can be misunderstood as a Hollywood film which is both good and bad on its own. As I said, the visuals in this movie are hands down beautiful - and I have to admit that this is maybe the best CGI that I have seen in any animated feature till now in both anime and cartoons. That doesn't mean, however, that it is perfect, cause it's not. Character designs look realistic, in some moments almost like a real people, backgrounds especially the design of the capital of Lucis is beautiful. Everything looks good and sometimes too much realistic. The fight scenes were nicely animated with a decent choreography so that every action fan can enjoy, but at the same time, action scenes are probably my biggest complain about animation segment. They could have been much better choreographed, they are at times too much confusing and viewer can't really tell what's going on the screen.   
 
The soundtrack was composed by John Graham and it was like you may expect it to be: standard for a ""Hollywood action flick"". That means that OST itself is pretty much what you would expect: some epic orchestral tunes for action scenes and much calmer pieces for normal scenes. My biggest complaint is that the OST doesn't provide anything new, anything that will stand out and that can you listen on it's own thus making it forgettable. Sound effect were great and it was given a lot of detail even for a small movements in order to make you feel like it's a real thing, and that deserve a notice. Voice actors in dub are some of my favorite western actors like Sean Bean (Ned Stark from 'Game of Thrones' and Boromir from 'Lord and the Rings') as a King Regis, Lena Headey (Cercei Lannister from 'GoT') as princess Luna and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman from 'Breaking Bad') as Nyx, so you could imagine my hype when I read their names on the trailer video. But, as some critics that reviewed film said, they weren't at their best with this roles, it almost feels like they are here just to sell their names which is shame, cause all of them are great actors in my opinion. 
 
The story was fairly simple and generic and as that seen many many times before. You have your typical magical kingdom surrounded with some magical barrier which is shielding them form dangerous country of Nifelheim, which conquered the rest of the world expect from Lucis. And then, some cool guy from Nifelheim goes to king Regis and tells him that in order to maintain peace he has to agree to marry his son prince Noctis (who is a protagonist of the game by the way) to princess Luna, a former princess of some forest kingdom called Tennebrae or something. Okay, I talked too much and I said that this will be spoiler free so I'll just say this: we got a flashback where we see Noctis for the first and last time in the film, then that flashback is never fully explained, some characters die and we never get an explanation why they died, how did they found out what they found out, we have predictable plot twists etc. The characters doesn't have that much of reedeming quality either since they are all basically just one dimensional figures thrown there to entertain you. The only one that I liked was Nyx. Well, I know that this is a film and that it is an advertisement for a game, but it is also a form of a prequel for the game and for that one it should set the scene, setting and conflict for a game so that main characters in game can develop. So in that aspect, this movie fails pretty hard. but if you look at it as a advertisement for a game and action popcorn flick, then I guess that you will have fun. 
 
So, basic conclusion of this maybe unneeded wall of text is: you should watch this movie if you: 
- are a fan of the game franchise, because in my opinion this film is besides FF VII Advent Children the only worth anime adaptation of the games 
- want to watch some damn impressive CGI 
- you are a fan of english voice actors, but be aware that thy had much better days in this career and that they definitely won;t be remembered for the roles in this film. Maybe that's the case because the characters aren't very well written and likeable, but who knows... 
- if you enjoy action flicks in style of moder Hollywood movies; 
 
So, that's it, I hope that this HUGE review will help you out to either checK this film out or skip it. I f you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, feedbacks are appreciated.

    TL:DR version: Pointless. Pretty, but pointless. Pretty pointless. 
 
Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is the supplementary CGI movie prequel story to Final Fantasy XV, and if you don't know what Final Fantasy is, then I'm amazed how you were able to watch weeb trash and not know what the FF franchise is. Anyways, this film was made to tell the story of how the city of Insomnia fell and how the Kingsglaive (fancy super knights) and the King failed to save it, for in the game you don't witness the events personally. The real reason why this film was made was so Square Enix to get some extra cash for a game they've put so much time and development into, that if the game wasn't a financial success, the company would have been in the red by now. Also to reuse some scenes that were made for the game, but did't fit into the narrative very well during who knows which version of said game. 
 
Now Lucid, you say that the film is a prequel to this game, and from the description that you gave it, this story seems like it's of some level of importance, but you called it pointless, why so? Well I'm glad you asked! Nothing in this film really expands on the story or world in any important way, at all. Everything you learn in the film can be learned in the game itself, and it doesn't really flesh out anything important to enhance the experience of playing the game. 
 
You see, a prequel has to do these 2 things to be considered something worth watching. It must properly flesh out the story and/or world of something that you watched, read, or played. It has to be that puzzle piece that you had no idea was missing, and once you fit that piece in, it fit very well into the overall picture. And 2, it must stand on it's own as a story. If it's just more fleshing out and world building, that's fine, but it's something one would really tell someone else to sit through unless they really liked this other thing they sat through. 
 
I am ""glad"" to say that Kingsglaive fails at both. I've already described why the film doesn't really do anything to help with the story of XV, but as a stand alone story, it's a really boring action film that looks pretty, sure, but I can't feel anything for the garbage characters or generic plot this film is trying to make me like. More on the boring action, everything is so overblown and over the top, you really lose any sense of pleasure early on, and everything afterwards is just on the same level, therefore being unimpressive. And the characters are so underwritten that I can't really care if they're in danger or not. The OG Gundam animation is dated as all hell, but anytime Amuro fights Char, I am hyped because the series has built up those two characters so well, that I want to see them fight, even if the animation is super weak by modern standards. 
 
And I talk about the action so much because that's what this film has going for it really. There's not much to talk about anything, so best to talk about the 1 thing it really wants to show off, and it fails at doing that. Really, there was 1 time I enjoyed my time watching this movie, and it would be spoilers so I shouldn't really say. Still, it's not like I would even recommend anyone this movie, so I won't say ""Watch this one short action sequence, it is so worth the rest of the trash that this movie is!"" 
 
Well, the other thing this movie wants to show off is how pretty it is, and while yes, the CGI animation is impressive, and will probably age well thanks to the style not really aiming to be realistic, the art direction is very colorless and cluttered. You will mostly remember the colors black and white, and dark grays. And particle effects, lots of them. Now I'm not saying that having a less colorful aesthetic is inherently bad, far from that, but this movie doesn't really pull off the look it wants to go for. 
 
Once agai, really boring and pointless, looks nice, not offensive. Oh yeah, I watched this in English, and some of the English speaking actors were either given terrible direction or are just bad. The lip flaps (save for the final scene after the credits) were impressive, but still, weak dub. Can't say I saw the Japanese, nor do I really want to. Yeah.

    Don't listen to the critics, they usually have no idea what they are talking about. This movie is fantastic. The world is beautiful and the CGI is breath-taking. This is an amazing action film which a really great story that has a lot of lore to add to Final Fantasy 15. If your a fan of Final Fantasy you are sure to love it. The story shows the war between the Kingdom of Lucis and the Empire of Niffleheim and I am really looking forward to seeing which parts of the movie will be mentioned or be expanded upon in the upcoming game. The fight scenes were some of the best I have seen in an animated movie and the characters really incorporating the warping magic into their fighting styles. Overall this was a really enjoyable movie and I recommend any Final Fantasy fan to see it. I rate this an 8/10.

    The visual & audio appeal in this movie is off the charts.  The CGI is mind-blowingly amazing while the story offers nothing deep or surprising. 
 
There is a crap-load of jam-packed action scenes occurring at least every 10 minutes throughout.  I'm talking like a Kraken on an AIRSHIP fighting teleporting knights, or Pacific Rim scale battles while ANOTHER dragon ball like battle is happening between two people WHILE at the same time the two GIANTS are fighting eachother... INCEPTION!    
 
Seriously though, don't go in thinking there is a great & meaningful story to be told here.  Although, I can gladly say the story of Nyx (the MC) was presented in a mature and refreshing manner.  It avoids typical cliches or cringe-like moments common in fairy-tale like stories.   
 
One should be able figure out the premise of the story fairly quickly.  Less time is spent explaining the intricacies of the world and instead, more time is about putting you inside it.  It forces you to experience it through the eyes and life of Nyx, who's simply a badass. 
 
There was so much crazy stuff happening all the time in most of the action scenes, it was almost comedic at some points, seriously.  Anyways, just pure action and entertainment throughout, while simultaneously presenting the beginnings of FF15 in a stylish fashion. 
 
Let's just now hope that S-enix can deliver and retain the quality in FF15 this time around, far gone from the days of the S-soft era...

    I have been a Final Fantasy fan since the old days and although it's my favorite video game series of all time, I have to admit that the animations and movies based on the series are not always up to par and some times even horrible, but thankfully this is not the case with this movie. It is definitely worth 2 hours from your daily routine just for the visuals alone. 
 
Looks/Animation:  
This is the strongest part of the movie. The graphics used are some of the best if not THE best you have ever seen. The characters look realistic to the point that sometimes you confuse them with real actors (although there will be times that you will spot an occasional weird looking guy, but it's rare). The backgrounds are majestic and immersive in such a way that makes you wish that you could live there. Fantasy and reality blend nicely in a way that doesn't seem out of place and if you are interested in the game, it will really make you want to explore this beautiful world in full when it comes out. 
 
Story: 
The story is basic Final Fantasy stuff: The Machine Empire tries to take over the Magic City with the Crystal and Heroes try to stop it! If you have been an avid Final Fantasy player, this will remind you the FF AGITO story but it's only natural if you consider that they were based on the same universe before they rename FF VERSUS XIII into FFXV. This movie serves as an intro to the actual game story line but it's more than that. Square Enix didn't try to just ""cash grab"" with this. They put an effort to show the inner struggles of all the characters, so you can sympathize with their motivations better and it succeeds. This is not JUST an intro, but a good full movie with its own heroes, villains and ending. 
 
Characters: 
The main good characters are a team of bad-ass soldiers working for the good king trying to support their homeland vs the oppressor. Nothing too outstanding but none of them are dislikable either. The protagonist (Nyx) is your standard over the top action hero, but that doesn't mean that he is one dimensional. He succeeds in making you feel with his troubles and you end up supporting him till the climax! The rest of his team are also well portrayed with their own motivations and conflicts. Not many of the bad guys are shown here (they definitely keep them for the game) but for their little screen time the succeed in making you interested in them. Particularly the opposing Emperor manages to stand out a lot! His composure, his witty lines, his whole plan make for an outstanding villain Ruler and I can't wait to see more of him when the game comes out! 
 
Overall/Enjoyment: 
If someone tells you that this is not an enjoyable movie he outright lies. It has lots of action perfectly choreographed, lots of drama, some funny moments, good music, great visuals and if you are a true Final Fantasy fan you will spot many many many references to keep your inner fanboy excited! Real fun from the beginning to the end. 
 
TL/DR: 
This is a great movie, as a fanboy I would rate 11/10, but since I have to look at some minor weakness objectively I give this 8 or 9/10. Watch it, you will not be disappointed.

    Being a Final Fantasy fan who has been following the development of Final Fantasy XV pending its release, I decided to watch Kingsglaive as soon as it was released in the theaters. I will try to give my impressions of each individual aspect of the movie while withholding spoilers, thus keeping this review short. To sum it up - there is nothing that will blow your mind out of the water in this movie besides the animation, but it is definitely worth a watch if you're planning to purchase and play the game - it stands as a decent prequel to the game, although not so much as a stand-alone. 
 
 
There is no shadow of doubt that the strongest point of the movie lies in its animation . Rather than engaging in redundancy by attempting to describe the animation in words, watch the official trailer on YouTube to see it for yourself. It's worth the two minutes of your time even if you're not a Final Fantasy fan. The depiction of Insomnia is extremely immersive and it does its job at getting me excited to begin exploring the world of Final Fantasy XV.  
 
 
The story is nothing standout if one views it as a stand-alone movie. However, I consider that the main purpose of the movie would be more of an introduction to the world and historical background of Final Fantasy XV as it is a prequel to the game after all. While the story might be simple and rather predictable, I think keeping it this way as a prequel to the game was the correct decision as having a convoluted story with plot twists out of nowhere would spoil the movie's purpose of being an introduction as it will scare away a part of its target audience.  
 
 
The characters are not particularly outstanding, but commendable nonetheless. The main character - Nyx is likable and will get you rooting for him throughout the story. By the end of it he will be remembered as a badass. One thing I must give credit to the creators for is the fact that they did well to show the plight of some of the characters in the story and their moral conflict within themselves in a not overly-complicated way. This movie did not just keep so simple as to merely - ""Oh, this guy is good. This guy is bad,"" but actually displays why some of the characters in the show make the decisions they did, which gives way more depth to their actions. Although I think there could be more focus on that moral conflict, it was sufficient for me to see these characters as more than just mere generic good guys or villains.  
 
 
Being a Final Fantasy fan, I could notice and appreciate many references to creatures that exist in the Final Fantasy universe, increasing my enjoyment of the show. My only complaint would be the fact that some action scenes can get really messy, which does make it unclear and possibly even confusing as to what is going on. I also thought that the action scenes were slightly too drawn out. However, it is far from boring and it didn't detract from my enjoyment and viewing experience.  
 
 
Despite this not being mandatory to play the game, do give this a go if you are planning to play the game. It's worth it as it serves as a decent prequel and adds hype to the upcoming release of the game.

    ""I went in expecting nothing and still got disappointed"". This sentence sums up Kingsglaive succinctly and accurately. Of course, for a more detailed explanation of why this movie is somehow worse than that cash grab that is Advent Children, I'll be spoiling the film below. If you care about the story and/or have no qualms paying 10 bucks or so for a ticket, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, welcome, dear reader, to another episode into the dark spiraling hell that is my review. 
 
Spoilers start here. 
 
The movie begins promisingly enough, a simple prologue that explains the world and its inhabitants well enough. However, after that comes a poorly shot fight scene. This fight scene is a prime example of one of the movie's greatest downsides. As pretty (and I mean pretty) the CGI is, the frantic and erratic camera following the fight make it difficult many times to even comprehend the action and the stakes involved. However glamorous or epic the scale of the action is, the erratic camera makes the action scenes far less enjoyable than it should, which is a damned shame. 
 
As we enter the movie proper, you may notice that the lip syncing is way off. Which is curious, considering the movie was shot with the English voices first. Not that it matters much, especially considering how atrocious some of the dialogue is. None of the characters in Kingsglaive speak like normal humans. The biggest offender is Lunafreya, the main heroi- damsel in distress of the film, who seem to speak entirely in what I call ""Trailer Bait"", who goes on vaguely saying such gems like ""I must fulfill this destiny for it is my duty to fulfill this destiny"" or some ""destiny""-infused nonsense. Nyx's dialogue is mostly passable, he seems the most human of them all. It is really jarring to see how disconnected and artificial the dialogue is seeing as the actual game itself (judging from recent gameplay footage), and hell, the anime, have the characters speak naturally and normally. Ardyn's dialogue I rather liked, although that could be chalked up to how much fun his VA is having with is character. His scenes are a pleasure to watch, few as they are. 
 
The story itself is simple, but poorly told. Many characters seem to be written backwards. What I meant by this is that, instead of having a character's motivation naturally progress them into a situation, most of the characters seem to have a purpose or a scenario they are required to be in and the writing tries to force the characters into fulfilling this purpose or being present in the scenario by whatever means necessary. An example off the top of my head is Libertus' betrayal and redemption. So the big guy gets mad, betrays the glaive, and feels bad after seeing that the Resistance members are all nutcases, and then comes back to save Nyx. His arc is so poorly formulated the only reason I can think of why he's written like this is because the writers wrote the scene near the end with Nyx struggling with Glauca near the end and they needed to write someone in to save him. That and Luna needs a driver and Cor's nowhere to be found (Cor's probably in the trunk of the Regalia methinks). Ravus' arc was pretty lousy as well, so he hates Regis for not helping him despite it was the Empire's fault his country fell and now he's actively harboring a personal vendetta against Regis specifically? Uhh, you go dude. I'd hate it if he ended up as the Main Villain of FFXV, his motivations are lousy and weak.  
 
Ultimately the story ends as an ad for FFXV. Not complaining about this in particular, since this was basically the purpose of the film, but I'm sure a lot of casual moviegoers would be left disappointed as the whole story thread isn't resolved even after the end. Instead, the whole purpose of the film is basically to act as the 2 hour opening CG cutscene to FFXV. In that retrospect I can't hate it as much, but then I remembered I spent money to watch the opening cutscene of a game that isn't out yet. 
 
At least Advent Children had a proper story with a beginning and end and the plot is resolved. Sure it reuses the same plot threads, but at least I knew what was going on in that Bahamut fight, the same cannot be said for the Ultros fight here. 
 
In summary, this movie is a beautiful mess. 
 
2/10. 
 
 
 
Also where's my boy Cor in all of this? And Etro?

    I have not read the manga, this is an anime only review. I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. 
 
First off, don't let the fact that it has an all male cast taint your view. This is not yaoi or shounen ai. 
 
The story is pretty simple, there are four prince brothers who are in desperate need of an education before they are eligible for the throne. 
 
The story starts when their latest tutor shows up, will he leave in a hurry like the others before him? or will he be able to do the impossible and mold these young men into proper candidates for the throne. 
 
I really loved this show. It has stunning visuals that use light reflection in such a beautiful way. The background art is beautiful, the characters all have their own unique look. There is also a good amount of chibi used in the humorous moments that really sell the scenes. 
 
So if you are looking for something fun to watch with a good amount of humor and some emotional moments, you should give it a try.

    This was my favourite anime of the season and is pretty high up there overall. While at the beginning I thought it would be lacking in plot and just be about cute princes the plot development was great and kept me on the edge of my seat. 
 
More into the plot I've given the story a 10 as, the backstories of each prince and Heine himself are great, they actually make sense in terms of storytelling and characterisation while allowing the plot itself to develop. The underlying issue about who is trying to sabotage the princes and the lack of knowledge about Heine's past keeps the story interesting. 
 
The storyline allowed each character to develop while viewers gain insight into their past and the challenges they must overcome.  I really loved this aspect as not many anime choose to have a holistic focus on so many main characters. In terms of each character individually, they were all very well fleshed out and character relationships were great. Due to this I've also given characters a 10. 
 
I've given the art style an 8 because while it was good to look at, and tied the story together it was nothing amazing. Even so, the character designs and overall aesthetic looked great. 
 
For me the sound was a 7, I'm basing this mainly on the introduction and ending songs as there wasn't much music throughout, or not that I noticed much. Both introduction and ending song were great and I encourage viewing them, they fit with the theme of the anime and worked very well. What drags this score down is the lack of sound elsewhere. While I typically don't focus on sound and did't notice anything bad about in the anime sound wasn't really used to change the mood. 
 
I really enjoyed this anime, watching it was fun and the numerous cliff hangers made waiting for each new episode a challenge. I've given the enjoyment value a 10. 
 
As such I really recommend watching this anime if you get a chance. While it seems aimed towards a female audience don't let character design fool you, the storyline and character development make up for any issues. Overall I've rated this anime a 9 and will hope for a second season.

    When I was scoping out the Spring 2017 Anime line-up, The Royal Tutor didn’t really hit my radar. From the synopsis and the preview graphics that had been released, I honestly thought it was going to be a very cheesy show with some strong boy-love vibes. As a person who doesn’t usually go for the boy-love genre, I wasn’t interested in it at all. But something about it, and I have no fricking clue what, told me to at least watch the first episode so I could confirm my feelings. I’m really glad that I listened to that tiny, not-so-weird-at-all-little-voice-in-my-head because this series ended up being surprisingly decent. 
 
When I began it I got a very strong Ouran High School Host Club aura from it. You’ve got four boys who very quickly get unique names via our Heine-sensei, and they each have a relatively tropey persona. Initially, this made me very hesitant in watching the second episode. No offence towards Ouran, but this trope is so fucking overdone that I didn’t want to deal with another show that revolved around it. Luckily, my fascination with the mysterious tutor outweighed my frustration and I continued onwards. 
 
My expectations for the show started to grow, but didn’t really turn into anything fantastic as I watched. Mid-way through the season when we still hadn’t learned anything about the Royal Tutor’s past, I began to feel highly sceptical about the writing. I knew that we were running out of episodes and time for a good, fluid explanation of how a teacher could also be so skilled in combat as to equal a highly-seasoned warrior. There were some very vague hints, but not much else to go on. I also found there to be a slight imbalance on the attention given to each of the four boys, where a couple of them received a lot more screen time than the others. These two aspects actually filled me with a bit of anxiously negative anticipation. I’ve seen it many times before. A show starts off wonderfully, but then it overreaches and falls terribly short in its execution. Luckily, that didn’t really happen with The Royal Tutor. 
 
While it’s far from being a glorious masterpiece, it has a decent number of facets that make it quite an enjoyable anime series. The first are the characters themselves. We get to learn about each one of the boys and why they are so vehemently against tutors and education. The reasons aren’t superficial. They are laced with insecurities and bad experiences. Occasionally a reason for one son will seem minor in comparison to another, but it just adds an empathetic dimension to their personas that makes you want to root for their success. I like that these boys aren’t perfect. Their flaws make them that much more engaging. 
 
The tutor himself is someone who reminded me of Onizuka from the anime series GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka. He is a man who took the time to understand the underlying issues that kids have in order to better tackle them with a fitting solution. Heine and Onizuka knew that kids aren’t going to respond to a one-size-fits-all solution. Each kid is different with unique issues and problems. To help said kids, you really have to be willing to get to know them and distinguish them as individuals in a way most people don’t want to deal with. 
 
Remember how I mentioned earlier I was worried about the imbalance of screen-time for the boys? It turns out that some of the boys needed the extra attention because their problems needed that extra support. It also played very well towards plot progression because the imbalance was created to fit the unique issues and insecurities that each of the sons were going through. For example, one of the kids is a very shy and timid person with a fearsome outwardly appearance. He wasn’t shown nearly as much as I had hoped (he became my favourite character because I could relate to him like you wouldn’t believe) because of this demeanour. It wouldn’t have made sense for him to be sprouting up all over the place, unlike the youngest brother who’s a social whore. 
 
The themes in the show were also a bit comforting. Most of it had to deal with accepting yourself for who you are, even if other’s can’t accept you. It was dealt with in a positive way that doesn’t negatively portray awkward social skills, or fetishise issues involving a lower intelligence, etc. etc. I like that the changes that the boys make are gradual instead of just being an instant fix as soon as they comprehend the lessons they’re learning. There’s also a bit of focus on not judging anyone by their appearance or initial mannerisms because there’s a huge chance that you will be wrong about them, friendships come in all shapes and sizes, and soft things will always be cute. 
 
All of these elements made for a pleasant watching experience, however, it does have its faults. The humour, while being kooky and a light-hearted means at softening tough topics, is really predictable at times and felt cheesy and out-dated. The story in its entirety is of average quality and can make you feel pretty indifferent about whether you’re having a good time or not. Although I do like the characters, nothing within the The Royal Tutor truly made me anticipate the next episode with impatient, passionate glee. I felt so apathetic about having to wait a week for new content, or when the content finally did arrive I’d watch everything else before really getting to this. The only thing that I was super fricking curious about was Heine’s past, which was a small bit of a let-down because the morsels of clues left in the wake of one episode to the next made it sound like Heine would have a really badass history. Instead the truth was disappointing and anticlimactic. 
 
The animation itself is pretty much typical; nothing extraordinary or breath-taking. It’s clean and seemingly well-developed. I found the outdoors scenery to be more pleasant than the interiors. There are a lot more details that go into creating the environment and atmospheres amidst nature than within buildings. We see this with the mansion, or palace, as it just felt like an atypical reproduction of a European mansion that seems quite standard in anime with such structures. Within a local café in town, we get a similar situation. The café does look to be quite large and it is nicely presented, but it doesn’t encapsulate the same sort of attention to details that the natural atmospheres do. 
 
Mid-way through the series, we do get a whisper of a small plot that’s being hatched to affect who will inherit the throne if and when the king passes on. This is something that felt extremely out of place to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, it randomly just pops up at the finale of an episode or two and then isn’t brought up again until a few episodes later. Secondly, when it is brought up, it’s only for a couple of minutes; not nearly enough to make any sort of impact. It makes one last appearance during the final episodes, and it honestly felt like the only reason it was tossed into the series to begin with was to add some tension and intrigue to the plot. 
 
Overall, The Royal Tutor is a good, fun average anime to check out. The cast is engaging and you can’t help but feel for them in certain situations. The story is very chill and simple, as is the animation and music. But if you’re in the mood for something that’s going to blow your mind, or totally make your jaw drop, then this anime is not for you.

    This is one of the most underrated shows this season in my opinion... OK...  Lets start with my review. 
 
Story - 8 
 A Royal tutor is hired to teach four spoiled princes. Well not unique or original. We had Great Teacher Onizuka and Denpa kyoushi before this. 
 
Art -  7 
The art is decent. well.. Good for a comedy anime. the chibi moments were funny. 
 
Sound - 8 
OP-ED was okay. 
Voice acting is really good considering the fact that most of main characters are voiced by fairly new voice actors and those who have not voiced many roles. 
 
Music-7 
OST is composed by Keiji Inai. The man behind the soundtrack of ""Is it Wrong to pick girls in a Dungeon"" and ""Heavy Object"". The soundtrack is decent for a comedy anime and fits the atmosphere perfectly. 
 
Characters - 8  
I really like the main character. he's kind of overpowered. All four Princes have their own unique personalities and get good development throughout the series. which is quite surprising coming from comedy anime. 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
 
Overall I really enjoyed this series. Even though it's tagged as a comedy it has equal amount of good drama. This series is a mix of Barakamon, Denpa Kyoushi and G.T.O...  If you liked any of those then I recommend you watch this.

    (NOT A SHOUNEI-AI/BL/REVERSE HAREM ANIME! ) (No Yaoi Undertones) 
 
My god is this anime heartwarming! I never thought that I will like this anime this much.  
 
The main focus of this anime is definitely its characters. Each character is very relatable. Although their personalities are still pretty cliche but I still love it. I didn't find any characters in this anime to be annoying. Every character has their childish side and this anime shows how they develop to become a full noble prince. 
 
The OP and ED theme are both catchy enough. The visuals are nothing special. The dance sequence by the voice actors for the ED theme is pretty well choreographed and fluid. For an idol fan like me, they did impress me.  
 
The art and animation done by studio Brain's Base is spectacular and detailed. They put a lot of effort into the last episode and I love it.  
 
The ending for this series is very satisfying and the developments given to the characters didn't went to waste. Although the ending is predictable, nevertheless they still did a good job at executing it,  
 
I highly recommend this anime if you like anime like Assassination Classroom or you just want a heartwarming SOL anime.

( This is my first review here I hope its okay)  
 
So I went in with this anime, with very little expectation as I thought it was going to be just fan service with cute humor. But as it went on, I started to enjoy this a lot more then I thought I did.. Yes it does have that ' fan service' feel too it, but don't be scared to try this out, its not cringy, every episode was entertaining, there wasn't any boring filler episodes.. Every episode will make you smile, laugh and cry.  
The most part of this anime I have to say I loved the most, where all the characters. none of them fell into a shadow  of another, all characters where equally interesting, every prince had there own unique personality. I thought I knew who my favouite prince was, but after competing it all, I just cannot decide!  
Of course the main character Heine's was just fantastic. He showed very little personality, but he just gave so much..  
This anime will give you a lot of feels, and make you appreciate things more and to also judge less!

    Now, I had my doubts about this series and to be truthful, I had found it while looking at a 'yaoi list for 2017'. I had read the comments of said listing to find out it wasn't yaoi but I still decided to look into it. From the cover art, I felt it was visually appealing and upon reading what it was about, I felt it could be done well or be total trash. 
 
So I took the gamble, and give this show a try. Now, I was going to attempt watching it subbed, as I do most anime, but I had not been up to speed to reading subs as of late to when I found there was a dub, I decided to give that a shot so that I may also give my thoughts on that as well, as many people wish to know how dubs turn out. 
 
So, I think I will talk of that first. As far as dubs go, this was fairly well done. The voice fit nicely, and none were grating on the ears. If you saw the face, it was often the voice you'd think would be there. I will admit that at times, the voices did sound strained, it was mostly when the character should be shouting but were holding their voice back in a more controlled tone. When you think of the setting of the story, it does make sense. Royalty needing to control their emotions so as to not show their true self. So, aside this little bit, I still think it fit in some extent. 
If dubs had a rating section, I'd give it a 9. 
 
Now onto the show itself. The story was very engaging, it often had me on the edge of my seat and waiting for more. I wanted to learn more, about the princes, and the royal tutor himself. Even the King, who was a character all of his own and not simply a slid in side character, so to say. 
Story has been giving a rating of 9. 
 
The art was very appealing to the eye, having stunning effects and yet keeping a simple and yet elegant touch. I have to say I found myself admiring the hair, both in design and color. As an artist myself, it has inspired me to try and do a similar style. 
Art has been given a rating of 10. 
 
The music and effects of the show are very well done. I have to say that I did find myself either humming or singing along with the opening. It fits splendidly with the tone and feel of the show. And it didn't get tedious so that one could listen to it every episode it comes on. The ending was also very pleasing but I have to say that I did not pay as much attention to it, as it had a common feel to it that I often overlook. 
Sound has been given an 8 
 
The characters were all diverse and widely presented. No one had a standard personality, every one was unique and different. Even the guards who were simply side characters. I felt a connection with each that easily made the show more enjoyable. And there was clear development, you can easily see it happen with each new episode. And by the final one, you can see how they've all grown. 
Character has been given a rating of 10. 
 
I enjoyed it very much, from it's stunning story telling to it elegant flow of events and character development. It was a experience to learn about each character, important and not. And any new character that popped up, always gave an explanation or an idea of what their role could entail. It had me on edge and in depth from start to finish. 
Enjoyment has been given a rating of 10. 
 
Overall, I give it a 10 for a thorough presentation and well thought out story. So much so that I will have to look into the manga now that the final credits had rolled. I must learn more about the characters and their world, for it had caught my attention. I hope this review has helped in your choice to watch it.

    Hey folks, this will be a review for Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine. It's not often to find a good teacher anime as of late. Many shows have tried the super teacher theme, and very few have done it right. This happens to be one that has. 
 
The story revolves around 4 princes and their royal tutor. As the royal tutor he is charged with treating the kings 4 children equally, and grooming them for the throne. The show is episodic, each episode has its own issue which generally relates to a certain princes issue. Each prince has his own personality and strength and our MC Heine reaffirms their strength while twisting their weakness and making it work for them. 
 
Though each princes story was entertaining it was a bit bland on the world building. The fact that they are princes mattered in the most loose since. I knocked a few points off because I felt the world around the princes didn't matter, which clashed with the main theme a bit. 
 
The art was great. The soundtrack wasn't up my alley. 
 
The characters are what make this show. Heine our main character is the main source of comedy. He is a ""Full grown adult"" but has the appearance of a child. He's the mysterious super teacher archetype character but they don't go overboard making him crazy or fantastical. The princes all have their own personality, but describing them here would be a spoilers. I however really loved how they handled them.  
 
Overall I enjoyed this anime. I don't think Ill watch it again unless a season 2 comes out, which is possible. However I really want to hand it to the people behind the series. To write a story so its interesting, yet to not overstep you bounds and turn it into a crazy mess is rare. Each character was believable, and you get attached to them in a natural way. The side stories that crop up feel well thought out. The ending wraps everything up yet it also allows you a hope for a season 2. The comedy though thin was a well placed. The drama not overbearing, which I cant praise enough. 
 
In short I suppose the biggest strength of this anime is that it felt like it was a completed idea. You don't really wonder if they had different writers or a change in sensibilities along the way. If you like the first episode you'll like the rest of the show. 
 
TLDR: Pretty good. Enjoyable characters, good pacing, solid story with a solid ending. Give it a shot.

Story: 10 
Story is about 4 princes of Grannzreich kingdom who are in need of a tutor for their grooming to be a future king. They happend to reject all previous tutor, so king had to call, Heine Wittgenstein. All of them have different personalities with which Heine has to deal with in order to teach them well.  
Story is very sweet and it has a lot of lessons that are even useful for us as readers, not only for princes. 
 
Characters:10 
Characters development is great and afer every lesson they princes change their behavior and way of thinking. Each character has flaws and virtues and they are very easy to like. 4 princes are very different from each other and have never been out of palace. They have no image of how people live. I personaly like the most how they personalites develop during time and how they actions reflect that. 
King is also very interesting character and Heine brings a lot of myster in beginning.

I'm right now on chapter 59 and after every chapter I don't get cold. I can't wait for new story and I can't wait for some misterjes to be resolved. 
 
The only flaw of it is that story doesn't go as fast as I hoped it would, but it simply doesn't have to.

    To put simply, the characters are great!!!! I think the plot can be a bit slow moving and a bit repetitive with the -prince has a bad trait-> Heine helps to fix said trait->Heine acknowledges prince for who he is->everyone gets closer- in the beginning but each episode focuses on the adorable personality issues of all the characters and Heine has a past himself that we dive into. 
I don't think the art is anything too spectacular, but there is definitely nothing wrong with it and this anime's focus isn't to have the most beautiful scenes in anime. The focus of this anime is character growth and it is definitely meeting that goal!

    Although this has a very bishounen artstyle and pretty much a male cast, rest assured that it's actually a very refreshing series with pretty much nonexistant yaoi/shounen ai vibes.  
 
STORY: 
Truthfully as I have been watching this series I can't tell where it's gonna go, and that's a great thing. The plot is neither shallow or cliche and each episode makes you wonder and learn more and more. Overall we find out about each prince and their flaws and strengths and watch them grow, but this series takes on such a refreshing perspective of what may be some typical prince issues.  
 
ART: 
Well I may be biased as a female, but this is very pretty art. I've also been impressed with the backgrounds of western historical towns and castles.  
 
SOUND:  
The sound fits just right to where it needs to be used. I find the opening and ending alright, catchy but I'm not totally in love with them. I like the voice actors a lot for their roles, and although Heine's may be so unexpected I like that it is mature because that's exactly how his character is. The voice actor is also great at portraying his pettier more comedic moments as well.  
 
CHARACTER: 
When this series first started off its introductions the only character I was entranced by was the main one, Heine, as he seemed more atypical. The other cast of the 4 princes seemed to fulfill a lot of typical bishounen tropes of the tsundere, playboy, elitist, and cold hearted types. But despite this, The Royal Tutor explores all their characters positively and really does well in expanding their characters. We get to see their strengths and fears and Heine plays a pivotal role in directing their development, as he was meant to. I've been really impressed with some of the dialogue that provides a genuine sense of personality to the cast.   
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I've pretty much really enjoyed this a lot more than I intended to, as I was initially drawn to how pretty it looked. But Heine continues to impress me and I really like his character.

    The only limit this anime had was the episode count, really. 
 
Story: 
In its essence, it's a growing up story for four royally spoiled teenage boys. Each of the four princes are to be given equal attention by the tutor and so naturally, they all got equal characterization. While the plot is not complex or sophisticated, it's a heartwarming tale of four boys growing up to become wonderful and mature adults. Despite its simplicity, this deserves high marks for how well it is done.  
 
Characters: 
There are essentially 5 main characters in this anime and each of them receive almost equal development. The show does a splendid job painting a picture of what these four princes are like at the start - mostly arrogant or spoiled with their own idiosyncrasies that make them who they are. As the episodes go by, each of the princes learns something from their experiences and their tutor's guidance that helps them get pass their weaknesses as a character. Heck, even the tutor himself learns a thing or two by the end, albeit not as much as his pupils. 
 
Art: 
Excellent, for an anime. The character designs almost try to mimic the illustration styles of light novel illustrators. The backgrounds are equally vivid and detailed. 
 
Sound: 
Unfortunately the weakest point of the series. There aren't any particularly memorable tracks in the OST. The OP and ED do their job though and are thus quite adequate. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Overall, this one an anime that I very much looked forward to every week just because I could feel a connection to the characters in it. It might not be a change-the-world plot like Gundam 00 or Code Geass, nor is it an over-the-top masterpiece like Kill-La-Kill. It might not even contain philosophical themes and endless symbolism like Utena, but for a 12-episode show, it is like a good Macross show where the characterization makes it shine. 
 
Who's this for: 
-fans of anime with a European setting 
-Slice of life fans 
-those who enjoy growing up stories 
 
Who's this not for: 
-if you just wanted action porn 
-if you want strong female characters. Sorry, the only females are the maids and the princess who's too young to be important yet 
-if you want a sophisticated plot

    Story: 10 
A royal tutor teaching and grooming the princes to be good enough to take the throne. Another good laid-back type of anime with pretty boys. Relatively good pacing in terms of plot and having comedy as the genre lives up to this anime. Very funny one indeed (cute too), due to the chibi scenes and the personality of most of the characters. Watching this anime will give you a bit of the “Ouran High School Host Club” vibe, which is great since I love that anime so much. Plot can sometimes be pretty unpredictable and unexpecting to some viewers. Also, later on in each episode, each character will have a story about themselves and slowly know about Heine’s past. Lastly, the anime managed to end off with a good ending, made me smile so much ^^  
 
Characters: 10 
Was quite shocked to hear the voice actor for Heine. Did not expect it as his appearance doesn’t suit the voice given. That’s where this saying comes into play “Do not judge a book by its cover”. Personality of his definitely suits the voice. Ever since episode 1, I really, really love Heine. Good at everything, cool, cute, sarcastic at times, funny and knows his way of doing things. Compared to the majority, Heine’s my favourite out of all the characters while next to him is Kai. Each of them have really interesting personalities and I will not be describing all of them as you will see it for yourself in the anime as it progresses. It’s the characters and their development that keeps me going. Side characters were given a fair amount of show time too. 
 
Art: 9 
Pretty good and adorable, due to the chibi scenes. Manages to portray the emotions of the characters well through chibi art too.  
 
Sound: 
Great ending and opening songs. Found myself watching them instead of skipping it through a few times. However, there's one episode that you should look out for. The ending song is very different compared to the other episodes. It's my first time seeing such an anime doing that sort of ending too. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall: 10 
Overall, I love this anime as it's a great one. Definitely worth a shot as you will be in for lots of laughs and some sad moments as well. I binged most of the episodes and will be reading the manga now that I’ve finished the anime. Unfortunately, the translated manga seems to not have caught up with the anime yet. I hope for a season 2 where they’ll show who became the king in the end but with how they ended, I’m not too sure too…

    The Hakuemi and Mikochi is essentially just a 13th episode of the series. If you enjoyed the television series you should be able to enjoy this one. 
 
The OVA is split into two parts, the first part focusing on the Hakuemei's work partner, Iwashi, and the hair stylist,  Jada. The second part focuses on Hakumei and Mikochi as well as two new character, inn sisters Mimari and Shinato, who act as your classic nice and well-mannered little sister and loud and rude older sister (think Kyou-Ryou (Clannad) or Kagami-Tsukasa (Lucky Star)). 
 
As always, this anime has a unique art style and soothing soundtrack that fits extremely well it's relaxing tone. It'll almost be like you're cuddled up to the fireplace with the characters, it's just that comfortable.  
 
Since this is essentially an extra episode of the television series and since I've already talked about the new characters, I'm going to assume you're already acquainted with characters so instead of describing them, I'll talk about what I think makes this OVA special, the character interactions. 
 
You're always in for a treat when you see characters who have yet to meet finally get to that point and interact. Jada's lazy, yet welcoming attitude fits extremely well when coupled with Iwashi's kindness. Like any good slice-of-life, Hakumei and Mikochi's characters make what would usually be a boring task into something interesting through how the characters interact with each other.  
 
Overall, if you enjoyed the original television series at all, I would definitely recommend watching this OVA as well. And if for whatever reason, you haven't watched the original television series yet, I would recommend doing yourself a favor and watching that, and then coming back and watching this.

    This is the coziest episode of one of the coziest series in history. The first part is cute, but ultimately a throwaway story that others have summarized. The main story is the gambling. It's everything Hakumei to Mikochi does best: let these characters just do their own thing, enjoy the situations that unfold, and watch the (very low key) chaos fly.  
 
I truly felt like I'd want to be nowhere else in a snowstorm than in that exact place, gambling, drinking, and generally having fun with exactly those four people...although I damn well wouldn't be betting money given certain individuals...*cough* 
 
It was precisely how you'd want to hole up on a cold, snowy night. Good friends, games, sharing jokes, hot food, and a bit of alcohol to warm you up even more. It made me feel nostalgic for some nights like that in the past. I suppose it made me feel a bit sad, although I laughed much more. But I think that's part of Hakumei to Mikochi's charm as a series. It reminds us of the most important things in life...many of which are unappreciated in your average anime series. 
 
I'd rather live in the small, simple, quiet, and charming world of this series than any giant dramatic anime of any kind. I truly hope we can see more Hakumei to Mikuchi to come. I would hate to say goodbye to the lovely art and exceptionally high quality adaptation that we've seen in this series. It's been faithful to the manga and a gift to all those who have enjoyed the experience.

    Hakumei to Mikochi got its 13th episode finally. This directly continues the manga story where it was left, offering us few short stories that are of the calming sort - just like so many of the earlier episodes. 
 
We meet our weasel-carpenter who yet once again saves the day. Not because it is his job, but because he is a kind person who genuinely wants to help others. Surprisingly enough, our second story takes place inside winter scenery. Real beauty that one. At first, it felt weird how, despite the heavy snowing, there was no nature's sound present. Then I remembered how small our characters are and have to conclude snow has never looked as soft and fluffy in anime before as it looked now.  
 
The final part introduces us to a new Japanese gambling game which makes the series look like Kaiji (obviously less moe because Kaiji is super moe). Typical to Mikochi, even our games play along in a cheerful and friendly atmosphere. We see yet another evening where everyone is enjoying their time together so much it's practically impossible not to smile when witnessing this.  
 
Mikochi is so goddamn happy and charming series, and this exact episode is a perfect example of how good the show can be at what it does. The biggest flaw is how the series is only 13 episodes long instead of 50 like Shirokuma Cafe is. Those who loved the original series will be very pleased with this one.

    This short episode is the continuation of the first season of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and after watching it you start to wonder why it wasn't just included with the rest of the season. 
 
Considering it's only one episode, I shall try to keep this review rather concise. 
 
The story progresses a tad further than the original season did, although ultimately leaving you with the feeling you were wishing for more. The character development wasn't really apparent, but then again, nothing really happens in a single episode, so I can't be too harsh on such a matter. 
 
The art is pretty impressive, and makes the overall experience a whole lot better. The soundtrack in this single episode wasn't really striking, nor did it leave an impression, so I'd say it was rather forgetful. 
 
Overall you get exactly what you'd expect. If you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy this as well, just don't expect anything different.

    This is a nice little extra episode. Slowing down after the finale, Christmas is here and the friends are trying to get Rikka and Yuuta more romantically close. They through a party for just the few of them. Things happen and mistakes are made, but in the end its just Rikka and Yuuta that control their relationship and progress at their own pace. Rikka is nervous about love and does not fully understand it and Yuuta is patient, willing to wait as long as possible to give Rikka time to understand her feelings and what she wants to do. It's a sweet episode, full of laughter and happiness.

    Hey, another episode of Chuu2, isn't it cool? Yeah. Before I start, just want to let you know that I never read the light novels, and I don't really know what will happen in the aftermath, and of course, SPOILERS ALERT. So please read at your own will. (And BTW, review-virgin here, so please be kind until a good review comes out, lol) 
 
Good episode. And that's how at least I can describe it. Got rewarded for what I came for. Classical Chuu2. 
Had my laughs with Sanae and Nibutani, had my dokidokis with Yuuta and Rikka. But again, that's it. 
 
STORY: So we start sometime after the last episode from season 1, with the same things going as always for the Chuu2 gang, until they decide to host a christmas party. Since no one can do it, Deko steps up and offers her house, and so the OVA goes. 
 
Aside from our favorite number 1 christmas anime cliche (accidentally drunk girls) everything went okay, giving highlight to the ""femslash"" (as Commie would put) and the RikkaYuuta ""so close yet so far"" moment. Not bashable, though, as you couldn't expect for DAT development to happen on an OVA, after all. If there are any character development let's save it for season 2, thus earning a steady 6 on my CHARACTER and another 6 on my STORY review. 
 
SOUND AND ANIMATION; since the studio animated this right after or during animating the first season, you couldn't expect the powerful Kyoto Animation to disappoint. And they didn't. Everything from the animation part was nice and it maintained the same feeling of the original work. Soundtrack was good as we expect from KyoAni, even though the return of ""seizure OP"" does manage to be a bother, but it's nothing too big. Pretty much an 8 for both. 
 
Should you take your time to watch it? Sure! Since you can consider it as a prequel to the second season, with Yuuta and Rikka growing together as a couple and overcoming their problems (or so as I hope it will play out). If you are someone who didn't really like the first season, you should skip it as it doesn't add much.  
If you didn't like the announcement of the second season and the movie, don't be mad though. As a fellow fan of these other animes I'm sure as hell Haruhi, Hyouka, FMP or even Rewrite will get their own spotlights in the future (maybe Rewrite is just a big dream? lol) 
 
Since good things and ""bad things"" are even, and it felt normal, I'll leave it as an 6 (fair) OVERALL and ENJOYMENT for me, since the whole episode was just an opportunity for us to see the gang again, and perhaps have a sneak peek at the future season. It was pretty nice.

    A special 13th bundled episodes to round off the Season 1 of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, For me the original series was a blend of crazy/silly ""8th Grade Syndrome"" scenes but then mixed with the cutest & most heartfelt scenes (Usually ones with Rikka & Yuuta) Not many series can pull them both off well unlike this series.  
 
The ""Extra"" Episode was showing off the dynamics of perfectly. The story revolves around a Christmas Party and the chaos that ensues. I enjoyed the episode for what it was, Didn't felt rushed that much and was enjoyble to delve back into the wacky and wonderful world of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai. 
 
I also felt this Episode was a good appetizer for 2nd Season which was announced not that long ago and is rumored to be airing around November 2013.

    The story here is a pretty standard Kaitou Kid heist tale, but I feel like it's characters are well presented, and really bring some life to the story. The story pushes Conan into the background and focuses on Kid as the protagonist, but I found that to be more interesting, to be honest. There's also a pretty good twist on the story that I won't spoil here, but it was a good change of pace. 
 
The art is about on-par with the early Detective Conan TV series. It's good, I enjoy the character designs, and everything moves well enough... but there isn't any overly impressive or flashy sequences. Above average and gets the job done, but it's nothing special overall. 
 
Audio is about the same, but it's boosted a little bit higher because of the great soundtrack and solid voice cast. 
 
The returning cast are just as fun as they are in the main series, but the new characters that were introduced for this OVA are also fairly well done, which was surprising. All of the new characters don't really have the time to get too well developed over the course of 25 minutes, but the OVA still tries to give them a little bit of depth. By the end of it, I still managed to enjoy the moments the new characters had on screen... and I'd definitely like to see some of them return in future episodes. 
 
Overall, I really enjoyed this OVA. Parts of it definitely seemed somewhat average, but it really shined in other parts. Out of the Detective Conan OVAs I've seen (That is, the first four), It's definitely my favorite so far. 
 
I give this OVA a 7/10

    I am a huge Kaitou Kid fan so I was very happy to see an OVA that featured Kaitou and had Conan as a background character. I loved the story, it was believable and everything fit in place nicely. The story flowed smoothly and it was nice seeing Kaitou's thinking process.  
 
The art is very typical Detective Conan and like a normal episode of the tv series.  
 
Like the art the music is also typical of Detective Conan and it fits the story well.  
 
If you are a Conan fan then you will most likely be disappointed since he is not center stage for this OVA. Instead Kaitou Kid along with Aoko, Inspector Nakamori, a queen, and young prince are the main characters fort he OVA. The story did a good job explaining the background of the queen and young prince in the short amount of time and also showed believable growth for both the queen and her son. 
 
I loved Kaitou Kid so I enjoyed this OVA immensely. I would love to see the young prince return in a future OVA since he was adorable.

    It's still an ongoing series. But so far, I have enjoyed it. It's history, in a shell. 
 
Making history fun for those of you, who really dislike it. If you watch this series, I guarantee history will be much more amusing. 
 
Actually, having seen Hetalia I no longer take international relationships seriously in class, etc. Just because I instantly see the face of the country pop up in my head, and it's obnoxious. And there. 
 
So it's great for those of you who don't like history, because it will make you like it. 
 
Also, the concept itself is interesting, just from the fact that someone came along and decided to personify and stereotype countries. And it's especially hilarious how some of it is actually TRUE.  
 
Anyway, a series most would usually enjoy. Although it is mostly for females, since it has many male countries, and it does have the occasional hint of guy love. Nothing: fja;lkjfsdfakjd though. So for those of you guys interested, I'd watch it anyway, for the lulz. Who knows, you might get the ladies. xD

    When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

    Hetalia's original series has high production standards, high creativity, and high entertainment value. Hetalia's art gives off the vibe of a lighthearted kids' show, which serves to supplement the main character's (Italy's) childishness, while providing excellent contrast to the more serious parts of the show. The story follows main countries in the world leading up to and including World War II. The personification of the countries is hilarious while maintaining at worst a facade of historical accuracy (most often accurate). The show has great music that adds well to the short form of the series (five minute episodes). Overall, the show is a great watch that brings up a mood with little effort, and works well for something quick to watch.

    This is in no way a brilliant show, it is often portrayed as that but it is not.  The plot is creative but could have been done better.  I did enjoy this show, there was no logic behind my enjoyment but whatever.  
 
 I had trouble sometimes telling where, when, how, and who, hey could have made the transitions a ton less confusing.  The plot is all over the place and although that's ok when done well it jumped time periods seemingly at random without explanation.  The jokes hit most of the time but never got more than a smile out of me.  The plot is creative and I don't see how it's all that offensive but it can be confusing at times and could have been pulled off better. 
 
The characters are fine, personally I feel America was off somehow.  For all the history they covered I wish they would have had countries from the southern hemisphere as it is almost completely ignored.  The characters seem pretty good, shallow but not bad either. 
 
In all I enjoyed it, I don't know why I as the history geek I am liked watching history be so simplified and important events ignored.  I would recommend this on a day when you're really tired and just want to see something stupid but entertaining.

    Hetalia Axis Powers is a simple story of personified countries going on wacky 5 minute adventures and interacting with each other in simple to understand ways.  Germany, Italy, and Japan are considered the 'main' characters since the story supposedly takes place sometime during WWI AND WWII where the axis powers team up.  I had actually watched the series when i was 12, which seems like the only good window for the anime to be properly enjoyed especially if you have the attention span of 5 minutes.  
 
Story:5 
 
The story is fairly simple and can get pretty boring after some time, nothing really happening after the episode without having an everlasting effect on the plot. The anime tries to add some sad moments, usually between America and England but it just gets the audience to cringe. If you enjoy easy to follow stories with small tips of the hat to history, sure you could enjoy Hetalia. 
 
Art:4 
 
The art style is ugly, I'm sorry.  Each character has weird black marks on their cheeks which i guess is suppose to be a form of blushing? This series itself is old however so the newer seasons have much improved on it.  The backgrounds look unfinished and seem rushed, so the entire series looks like an otaku's first attempt on animating. 
 
Sound:5 
 
The music is pretty basic, it neither adds or destroys scenes it's just there.  The opening and ending themes are what make the show most popular and admittedly the opening is pretty cute but it does get old after a while especially if you're binge watching 
 
Character:4 
 
I would give it a lower score but I'd rather not be too harsh with one of my first anime with a strong nostalgia factor into these scores. The characters only have one personality trait and they're based off of stereotypes associated with each country.  Germany is angry.  Italy is lazy.  Japan is too serious.  America wants to be the hero (he's the only character i found funny first appearance).  You get the idea.  If you want a story with deep character development and a colorful cast of characters, don't even bother because this anime is pretty shallow.   
 
Enjoyment:6 
 
Honestly the fact it was the first anime I had watched on my own was the reason I gave it a higher score.  It was a pretty okay anime, really easy to get through with the short episode run time.  The episode were pretty entertaining when I watched them three years ago, but if I tried rewatching it I'd probably move on to something with a higher maturity level. 
 
Overall:5 
 
If you're into flat stories with equally flat characters, Hetalia could work for you.  Hetalia is a very basic anime, yet it's popular enough that you'll still want to watch it just because others always reference it.  It kinda fits in the category of entry anime, if you're young and want to watch an anime to get you introduced to anime, Hetalia can work with it's easy to follow plot and simple characters.  And if you're about 12 and want to fangirl over yaoi, that could always work too.

    Get read for a completely bias review from the biggest fan of Hetalia!!!!!!!!!! 
So here goes..... uh, and PASTA!! 
 
 
 
 Story: 6  
There is pretty much no plot whatsoever but that doesn't mean it's not a good series. It's a great series if you need a break from thinking or if you are incapable of thinking. 
Also, everything I know about History is from Hetalia so it is worth watching. 
But no plot.  
 
Art: 8 
I'm giving it an 8 because I enjoyed the art. It's cute. It's funny. But not anything special. (especially from Chibitalia - I WANT AN ITALY!!!!!!!!) 
 
Sound: 9 
A lot of people hate Italy's voice from FUNimation dub. I personally think it suits him. I REALLY like his Chibitalia voice.  
And the ending theme song fits it so well. ""Draw a circle that's the earth....."" lol 
 
Character: 10 
I love all the characters from Hetalia and I want them all as pets (especially italy from Chibitalia). They are total stereotypical but loveable. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
IN ENJOY THIS SERIES TO THE MAX!!!!!!! IT""S THE BEST THING EVEERRRRRRRRRR! 
 
Overall: 10 
Like I said. I love it. <----- it is my 2nd fave series (fave is fma brotherhood)

    Hetalia...one of the best and funniest anime...EVER! Even though the ep are only 5 min long, they fill up those five minutes and make em worth while. It actually pretty funny to actually how accurate it is.  
 
 
 
STORY: WWI-WWII time period...one of the darkest moment...turned funny. Its amazing how the writer make the story funny. Instead of guns...they hit each other. The story is almost random but yet not...the story is done in typical four panel style format. 
 
Art- Each character is very distinctly looking and easily recognizable. Their heights are done by average height of the people in the country. And all of them look like typical stereo type like germany tall muscular, france blond wimpy, etc. 
 
Sound- LOVE THE ENDING THEME!!!! also the voice cast matches too. I can  hear a little bit of accent in each character voices.  
 
Character-this..this...make the show!!!! They are soo funny!! Italy is wimpy and all. The way the characters of hetalia interact with each other is basically how their alliances were during that time. England kinda wants to disown america. Germany always has to help out Italy, etc. 
 
 
Enjoyment- I have so much fun watching this series. Its so true. And yes, Prussia still lives on. I lol so much at this series, i recommend it to everyone i know, even non anime fans. 
 
OVERALL-Just freakin watch this anime. It'll make history so much more entertaining and yes, i imagine the wars now between two characters not liking each other and it makes history memorable.

    My 2nd review~! Well, I loved APH alot so I figured I might as well do this. 
 
STORY: 
Not much of a story here, except that they're stories from the past, which means you can learn quite some history here. It's kinda unbelievable but this anime actually helped me alot with my history (beats history class sooo much, if only we watched this anime for history) and also made history (a once super boring subject) now very fun for me. (; Also, the comedy is really HILARIOUS! They parody the many different scenes of the past and I literally laughed throughout the whole show! (comedy are a plus for me and if you love comedy you should check this out I'll guarantee you'll laugh too) 
 
ART: 
The characters are nicely drawn, so is the background and such. I think they are well done in APH, because there's no moments where it looks like they are using only a picture or a few frames for a few minutes. 
 
SOUND: 
I love the sound! The ending is really adorable, and what's more is that it's sang in many other perspectives' of the different characters :D And I think it's really special that each country actually gets to have his/her own version of the ending at the end. The sounds also go very well with the show and it keeps the show smooth. 
 
CHARACTER: 
THE CHARACTERS. I LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS! (it's a little biased but) The characters are all so adorable! I really love the way the look and the way they're stereotyped on their respective countries! If you're watching this you're bound to laugh at all of their silly antics. Plus, I think it's great for girls because there's alot of bishies inside *winkwink* 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
I can't describe how much I enjoyed this show. Every episode was random, but it gave me alot of surprises. And another factor that added to the enjoyment was the COMEDY! Like I said, I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through (mostly because of the characters' sometimes stupid antics) and at the parodies they do of so many countries and such. Through this show it also helped me to learn history (unknowingly because I was too busy enjoying it) and I highly recommended to those who need a good laugh! :D 
 
OVERALL: 
Wonderful.

    I watched this show and all of the other seasons in summer, and I was honestly disappointed because of all of the hype and then I just seen this. My friend is in love with the show and I don't see why... 
 
STORY: 1 
Story? Story?! This anime has no story whatsoever. It's basically like a slice of life anime but a bit different. It's just the axis powers, sometimes the allies, going on about their daily business in WW2. (yet a lot of the episodes show 0 war themed content...) 
 
ART: 3 
I'm going to be honest, I hated the art. But I can't give it a one because this was based off of a webcomic by Himaruya and it's his older art. I still feel like it could be better but since it was a webcomic by some random guy that happened to get popular, I can't judge it. (because beginners at webcomics have a rough time getting used to the art) BUT the art was really good from Beautiful World and afterwards! 
 
SOUND: 8 
Okay, in the Japanese sub, the sound was decent. But since I don't speak Japanese fluently or know what types of dialects or accents there are, I didn't know if they even incorporated accents. (i doubt it, though) But the English dub had great voices! England's voice was my personal favorite. But Italy's voice was better in the sub; in the dub his voice was too high and it was creepy. 
 
CHARACTER: 7 
I'd judge this show's characters for the stereotypes which are sometimes false, but it's a satirical anime so of course they will be stereotypes. And Hell, some of the stereotypes are true. I'm American and we all love burgers and we're fat, yet the media shows skinny people, hence America eating a lot and being a healthy weight. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 7 
I hate to admit it, but I enjoyed this mediocre show. I don't know why or even how, but I did. I particularly enjoyed the parts with either the micronations or the Nordics.   
 
OVERALL: 5.5 
When you boil it down, the thing deciding whether or not you enjoy this anime is the type of person you are. I personally feel indifferent about it; I didn't like it, I didn't dislike it. But if you don't like basically random shows, Hetalia isn't the anime for you.

    This may be the only anime I will ever review. There was a point where I was a bit obsessed with the series and I've come here to defend it. 
 
TL;DR It's so bad, it's actually amazing, and it's not meant to be anything but such. 
 
Axis Powers Hetalia (which I will be abbreviating as ""APH"") is a satirical, historical comedy about amphomorphic countries. Each character represents a different country of the world and their interactions represent historical events, focusing mostly on the events of WWII. 
 
Story 6/10 
Art 4/10 
Sound 8/10  
Character 9/10 
Enjoyment 10/10 
Overall 6/10 
 
Before I dive in, it's CRUCIAL to know that the series is based on a webcomic that became way more popular than it should have. Both the manga and anime are really a collection of comic strips and there is not supposed to be much of a linear story. It's very much character based with enough random history to make it interesting. 
 
Story: 
 
Essentially what I said above applies here. There really is no linear plot line. While a lot of these episodes focus on WWII the series doesn't go through the events of the war chronologically and explain them through humor. I can see how it's a turn off to some, but one doesn't need to fully invest themselves within the story to enjoy the show. It's all about the characters and their relationships. Plus, the episodes are 5 minutes long. It doesn't take much commitment. 
 
If you enjoy unnecessary yet hilarious homoeroticism then watch it immediately.  
 
If your a history enthusiast, you will either be extremely disappointed or understand the show's value completely. To be honest here, this show is what got me interested in history. Maybe I'm overanalyzing but understanding history as individuals trying to understand each other's differences is really the X factor to the story. Or maybe it's the homoeroticism, who knows. 
 
If you want a goodAPH story, google George deValier. 
 
Considering the context of the anime's creation, it's worth a 6. If it wasn't originally a comic I would give it a 4. 
 
Art: 
 
The earliest APH comic strips used this art style, and the art style was maintained in the anime as homage to the creator. His style has improved greatly since and the later seasons of APH reflect this. The art isn't horrible but in compassion it's... not something you would write home about. It's decent for the times I guess? Backgrounds aren't great but this again goes back to the APH webcomic theme, which still isn't colored to this day. (And yes, there is still new content being released on a regular though the new seasons to quite catch up to it.) The art gets the job done at the very least. 
 
I might be a little nice by giving it a 4 to tell you the truth. Just look at the promotional poster. If bad art bothers you that much then skip ahead to the Beautiful World season if you want to give APH a shot. 
 
Sound: 
 
Say what you want about the ending theme, I think it's fantastic. It's so cute and catchy, and yes, it will get stuck in your head. Skip it if it will bother you that much. Each main character country has it's own version of the ending theme based on the culture of the repetitive country which I think is adorable. Italy's voice actor is fantastic, and I have no problem with the other VAs. I loved the background music, I found it very appropriate for the characters personalities. There are a bunch of character songs sung by the VAs that are great. You may get tired of hearing ""Doitsu"" all the time though. Also many characters have vocal ticks but they didn't bother me personally. 
 
Also, while no where near close to the original material, the English dub is FANTASTIC. It really serves for an American audience, and it's much more comedic than the original. Yes, it's more raunchy and maybe even tasteless, but it sure as hell is funny. The English VAs use these so-bad-they're-good accents and the writing, my goodness, I don't want to know the kind of drugs need to write ""I once killed a man with his own mustache and a grape."" said by Germany in the English dub. The dub is by no means what the creator ever intended but, whew, it's a trip. 
 
This is blasphemous, but I think I would recommend the dub over the sub. 
 
Character: 
 
Whew, I was so invested in APH at one point that even now that the hype is long over, I could go on and on about these characters. Since there isn't much plot the characters are pretty static, however the author really puts a lot of personality into the characters. There interactions and relationships are done well and are always accurate to the characters personality. If you ask a 13 year old yaoi fan girl you may get an over-reaction but the characters really are well done, and they do in a way represent a country's stereotypes. The stereotypical aspects of these characters is what makes the show comedic, if you take it to personally you won't enjoy it. I can't get enough of the character-country dynamics. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I did see the dub first before watching the sub. I watched both in their entirety including the following seasons. I can't say that I would have enjoyed it as much if I saw the sub first. But all in all, I was able to get very invested in the characters and the world that they lived in. Most of it is brain-dead euphoria, there is some seriousness that made me think about history in a new light,. The are fun facts, there are heavy relationships (not necessarily romantic of course, most of it is in a familial/brotherly sense), there are tomatoes and potatoes. I was able to read deeper into it than I was meant to. I laughed and I think a episode or two made me tear up a bit, but mostly laughing. Maybe you won't find it funny, I don't know. But its worth the chance that you will enjoy it for 5 minutes of your time. 
 
Overall:  
 
In conclusion, the anime is not meant to be a good anime, and that's what makes it a good anime. Parodies tend to get a bad rep on MAL because the rating system really account for stories that are meant to be bad, if that makes any sense. There's (almost) nothing as unique as APH out there. APH is by no means a Masterpiece but I would be lying if I didn't call it an ol' favorite of mine.  
 
(And if you do happen to enjoy it, look up some of the character songs!)

    Hetalia is a show that partly needs no introduction as it has become a large part of Anime culture. For those new though, Hetalia is an anime based on the personification of different countries. Each country is a stereotype of what Japan sees for them, and they don’t hold back punches. Heck, they don’t even hold back punches on their own country with their many quirks.  
 
The story line is a bit confusing as it jumps to different scenes rather fast. It’s easy to forget what had happened before in one of the on going scenes when it was about two or three episodes before it though if your marathon-ing it, that won’t be a big problem. Sadly, this also makes the show much harder to review, added to the fact that each episode is like 5 minutes. For this first season, it takes place around WWII when Germany, Italy, and Japan formed an alliance called the Axis (hence Axis powers). While this is a comedy and they are very loose with history, there are times they will explain what is going on using historical information. It’s a fun way to teach what happened, though they only scratch the surface. I can understand why too, you wouldn’t want to tear the comedy down by talking about the holocaust that happened or make jokes about it. That would make the show in poor taste.  
 
The characters are pretty simplistic, America likes to be a hero and scarf down hamburgers, England tries to be a gentlemen but can’t cook, France is a lover and loves fashion, and so on. Even Japan is made fun of a bit by his quiet and polite demeanor, not understanding why other countries do certain things, and his sometimes otaku tendencies. As the show goes on, you do learn more things about the countries, little things, but they keep the characters personalities simple still. There is a small part of the show where it’s called Chibitalia, where the nations are much younger and it follows Italy and how he grew up in Austria’s house. It’s a very cute part of the show and gives kind of a little back story. 
 
So I guess one of the questions that I get a lot is why people love this show so much. I think part of the answer lies in how open the characters are. Sure they are stereotypes, but their back story is the history of that country. I normally Role play online, and most of my role playing is the Hetalia characters as it’s easy to come up with stories. You can take a time period, like for example the revolution, and then ask yourself what could have happened then, what kind of people would the nation of met, why would he be fighting his brother, would it be for independence or something more? You can almost make the nations more human that way. 
 
The animation is really pretty and nicely done, popping between true figures and then Chibi style to add to a gag. There really isn’t much to say on the artwork since its pretty much the same as most other shows that came out in the same year. All the characters again are stereotypes of what you would normally see, England has bad hair and bushy eyebrows, Germany is pretty strong looking and is blond hair blue eyed, pretty much stuff like that. It surprised me that they made America also blond and blue eyed since most Native American’s weren’t like that but I guess the artist pretty much played off the German, Dutch, and English blood in America. I guess the stereotype of my country is more Valley boy and girl like California. (yes, I am American).  
 
When we get into the discussion of English vs. Japanese dub, there really isn’t anything against both. The Japanese and English are both rather funny and loveable for each character, I could pick out each characters voice after listening to it for a moment. The English voice does have one thing that the Japanese doesn’t – accents. Most of the accents are done well though if a native speaker were to hear them, they would probably laugh at how the English voice actors tried to mimic them. It adds a nice personality to the characters. Some of the words are a bit rushed, seeing as how these shows aren’t really the 30 min episodes so I had to sometimes watch it three or 4 times to understand them in those parts, but otherwise they are done to a point you can understand them. 
 
English also had to change a couple of the jokes because they did not translate well but the original idea is still intact. Looking between the English and Japanese, you can tell that the Japanese show their views of the other countries including themselves and the English feeds more off the American view of the rest of the world. I’m a little sad that my favorite character, Prussia, didn’t get much screen time or even get introduced really in this season.  
 
So is this worth a shot to watch? Definitely. It made me laugh, it was educational to some degree, and each episode is just 5 minutes long.

    Hetalia is a bit unorthodox with it's humor simply due to the fact that it relies heavily on making fun of/bringing light to racial stereotypes and tensions, particularly in the WW2 era with Axis Powers. If this isn't your type of humor, then this wont be a show that you'll enjoy as that's 90% of the content. Characters are written to be individual embodiments of these stereotypes, and their interactions are hilarious due to this. I'm someone that particularly enjoys studying the time period of the 1940s, and even for today, a lot of the humor holds its ground because misconceptions among populaces still exist. The show is also self-aware and makes fun of itself. 
 
As you can imagine, there's not really a story. There's no epic adventures, character growth, consistency, etc. Episodes are only 5 minutes and the only thing that happens are skits between characters. This sounds like it'd be a turn off, but the jokes kept me staying. Some characters can be obnoxious, like the titular Italy, but the satirical and self-aware humor makes up for it. 
 
Also, BL fanservice forever. What more could you ask for? 
 
One thing I would recommend: this anime is significantly better in the English dub. Along with the over-the-top and ridiculous accents, everything overall just tends to make more sense. The Japanese VAs did a fantastic job, but they English casting was well done.

    After seeing so much fan art on the show, I decided to give it a shot. The first few episodes confused me, since I really didn't know what the show was about. Even though, I kept watching and I eventually ended up really enjoying the show. I'm very picky with anime, and usually don't watch shows like this one.I love the fact they are short and I can easily fit them in my study breaks. I see them like little breather episodes. The characters are stereotypical, and each have a unique personality to them. However, that what makes the show so enjoyable. Most things are random and silly. Then others can be more emotional and with depth. This is one of my favorite shows now.

     I have friends that really like Hetalia, so I honestly though that I would like it too. However, after watching some episodes, it seems that I and my friends  have watched completely different shows. 
 
  Contrary to my beliefs, ""Hetalia: Axis Powers"" is not a satyrical and intelligent comedy about geopolitics,. it's more of a random series of gags with lots of fanservice to please fujoshis. Some gags were funny, but others were excessively nonsensical. And I also didn't understand all those ""Chibitalia"" segments: I'm sorry if you think they are cute, but for me they were just boring and useless to the ( nonexistent) plot. 
 
   Unfortunely, I can't say something positive about the art: it seems that Italy has his eyes shut all the time because it would be too difficult for Studio DEEN to animate them. The only interesting concept of the anime is the personification of the countries, but even this concept ended up executed poorly, mostly because of the short duration of the episodes ( 5 minutes). 
 
   In general, I think Hetalia had a great premise but wasted it's potential. This show could've been much better if the writers worried more with the plot and less with fanservice.

    I found out about this anime through memes, which lead me to believe a lot of things about it that weren't true. 
 
But despite that, I was pleasantly surprised by just how entertaining it was! 
 
Story - 7 
Because each episode is only 5 minutes long, there isn't that much of a focus on the story. The episodes are pretty well written, but they're nothing special. I liked the WW1 theme at the beginning, but as the story goes on, this theme is sadly lost. 
 
Art - 8 
The art is unique, recognizable, and fits the characters really well! The animation is average, however.  
 
Sound - 8  
The voices fit well, and the actors do a good job, for the most part. The FUNimation dub however, is a different story. Dear God, do I hate Italy's voice.  
 
Character - 10 
I LOVE the characters from this series, they're by FAR the biggest draw to Hetalia. Yes, they're all complete and utter stereotypes, but that just makes them all the more entertaining! However, I can see why a lot of people would find the characters annoying, especially when it comes to characters like Italy. 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
The characters are great enough to make up for a lack of plot, which helps in a lot of the episodes. There are no episodes that I could think of straight off the top of my head that I would call ""bad"". 
 
Overall - 9 
I would recommend this to people who want to look at something and say ""I don't know why, but this is funny."" But don't let the comedy fool you, there are a few really sad episodes, such as ""America's Storage Room Cleaning"" which sounds boring, but is one of the most emotional episodes. So yeah, if you're looking for something plot-heavy, look away. But is you like odd, and often silly characters, I say jump straight in!

    The key with something such as Hetalia is to not take it seriously. Hetalia, I believe, was made for purely comedic purposes. It wasn't supposed to be a heartwarming tale of heroics, a thought-provoking commentary on stereotypes, or anything worth giving a serious review to. 
 
Hetalia is kinda unique, if you think about it. There isn't anything both ridiculous and well-known as Hetalia. And they know it. They make fun of their own show. China, at one point, insults their own animation style. 
 
But even with the lack of plot and idiotic but clever idea, there was stuff about it that just wasn't good. 
 
The art wasn't anything special, I found Chibitalia to be unfunny and irrelevant, and the ending themes were SO ANNOYING. I guess the moronic ED was part of the ""don't take this seriously"" thing but still... 
 
But I enjoyed Hetalia. I stayed with it through all the seasons up until the movie. I found the English dub to be good as well, with everybody applying the appropriate accent to their characters. 
 
If you're looking for something funny and light, Hetalia may be the choice for you. 
 
If you looking for something with a little more than silly characters and a silly story, try a Studio Ghibli movie.

    Hetalia Axis Powers is a fun way to spend a couple of evenings! It's not an anime that requires a lot of thinking, it's a nice way to shot your brain off for a while and you might learn a couple of intersting facts a long the way.  
 
Story: 8/10 
The main part of the story revolves around World War 1 and 2. A part from that we get a lot of small side stories like the stories of Italy and the Holy Roman Empire. Hetalai jumps around a lot and it covers many aspects of world history in and interesting, funny and entertaining way.  
 
Art: 8/10 
I find the art very cute and funny. I like how they kept a sort of sketchy style (I know it's not a real word but hey!) with stick men and such. It still gets that web comic vibe even though it's an anime. And of course, the chibi style is kawaii! 
 
Sound: 9/10 
I watched most of the first two seasons in Japanese and I found it to be quite difficult to follow. Everything happens really fast and some times a lot of characters just talk over each other which made it hard to read the subtitles. 
 
I then gave the English Funimation dub a go and I loved it! I especially liked how the characters had silly accents which only helped stereotyping the contries in a cute and funny way. I did miss that in the Japanese version. 
 
I think both versions are good and if you are able to read subtitles very fast the Japanese version probably won't be a problem for you. If you, like me, have trouble reading that many lines that fast, the English version is just as good, maybe even a little better! 
 
Character: 10/10 
There isn't much to say here! I love all the characters and I find them very funny and lovable! I like how Russia still manages to freak me out even though they made him all cute on the outside. The characters are typical stereotypes and I think they fit how different people from different countries see each other.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I allways laugh a lot when I watch Hetalia. It's very entertaining and it's just what I need after a hard day of work. It makes me smile and that's what it's supposed to do! And I also think the 5 minutes for each episode is quite fitting. If they where any longer I think you would likely die from laughing so hard! 
 
Overall: 9/10 
Hetalia Axis Powers is a great anime whit great story and funny characters! I highly recommend it if you need a good laugh from time to time.

    A history lesson that's a little hard to keep up with. Well, with episodes lasting roughly 5 minutes, everything is quickfire learning. But you eventually get by. The very first scene in episode 1 got me interested and I was able to take in the fact that the series gives a human form to the countries of the world (Although at first I'd imagine England/Britain with darker hair, but I'm used to it now.) 
Though I'm sure I'll get all sorts of disagreement, I actually prefer the FUNimation dub. I'm sorry, sub lovers. The accents put me in a good mood to watch. Maybe the narration seems to be dumbed down (Poland is a country! In Europe), but I think it's more of a humourous way. 
The characterisation of the countries are... pretty much accurate enough.

    History is often a boring subject for people, and yet Hetalia Axis Powers makes it entertaining.  
 
Story:  
 
The story in Hetalia Axis Powers is certainly an interesting one. It basically follows the events of WW2, with each county as a character. The funny stereotypes, quirks, and odd history often become the basis for humor throughout the series. 
 
Art:  
 
I wish I could say more about the art in this anime, but it has what I view as the usual style. There's nothing too spectacular, although there are great moments featuring countries individual areas.  
 
Sound:  
  
Rarely do I have an anime that impresses me with the sound quailty. Hetalia Axis Powers is one of those for me. The individual accents of each character is heard, even in the subbed version. The theme to this anime will eventually get stuck in your head, though probably from hearing it so much.  
 
Character:  
 
I really loved each character in the anime. Not only is it funny to see each country as a person, the interactions are great. Unfortunately, it can be confusing to tell the names of each character at first. For me, this eventually went away rather quickly. The Chibitalia moments were amazing cute as well.  
 
Enjoyment:  
 
If you like history, stereotypes, and enjoy learning more about countries this anime is probably for you. Hetalia Axis Powers however is generally only a few minutes an episode. This can often be annoying, and some people might find it more trouble than it's worth. I'd recommend watching Hetalia, but not all at once. It's an anime you can easily stop and come back to weeks later.

    I'm one of those people who has a hard time sitting still and watching anime. So despite the fact that I love the manga, I wasn't sure if I should watch the anime. Then a friend told me that it was only about 5 minutes long. 
 
I love the fact that it's short. Because it keeps my attention with the comedy and fast pacing. I can sit and watch an episode and not have my mind wander.

    ***I originally wrote this review on Anime-Planet*** 
 
Please Note: The use of the asterisks in this review is for satirical uses, use your imagination while reading this. Also, excuse the use of “HETALIA!” throughout the review. This will be my first time using this type of satire in my reviews, so if you find this a little odd, please bear with me. 
 
Italy, once home of the strongest empire in the world has changed, now Italy is a coward who loves pasta and his friends as they live in strange events in world history. If you don't know what the hell I am talking about, give the show a try and you might understand it to a certain point of view. Have some pasta and Gracie! 
 
HETALIA!  
 
I really don't have much to say about the story because There isn't much story involved in Hetalia because IT BOUNCES FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER AND!!!... *A Gun is pointed at my head* ... Um, because it is a show full of political and historical satire. *Gun has been put away*. *I sigh* This is an anime that you might vant to turn your brain off and just accept it for vhat it is. You might not even like it, but that is up to you Dumbkophs! 
 
HETALIA!   
 
If I have to be technicar (technical), Studio Deen is responsible for the animation here and knowing Studio Deen has quite a numbel (number) of some known animes, this one is a bit diffelent (different) from the rest. Every episode on this show only last 5 minutes, that is because this is the only anime from Studio Deen that happens to be an intelnet (internet) series. This is also Bob Shirohata's first time directing an intelnet series and it should be made perfectly crear (clear) that style over substance is the way to go and it is excusable since it is an intelnet series. The animation on the other hand isn't pelfect (perfect) and does have some hit and miss featules (features) *Two guns pointed at my head* b-but the animation is quite cororfur (colorful) and makes the ""Chibitalia"" segments really cute. *Guns are put away*, Bakame! And please excuse my engrish 
 
 
HETALIA!  
 
 
The characters on the other hand are probably what contributes to some of the weirdest concepts I have ever heard for an anime. Characters named after countries? WAS SOMEONE HIGH COMING UP WITH THIS!? Well, since it is an internet series, who knows and who cares? *Three Guns pointed at my head* Okay, since it is an internet series... anything can happen. *the guns are put away*. The characters are funny in this show. Italy is a pussy, Germany is fine, Japan is alright, America is a loudmouthed idiot (Now I sound unpatriotic and DAMN YOU JAPAN FOR GIVING AMERICA A BAD NAME!), China is funny in some parts, Russia is awesomely funny when you see his bad side. His big sister Ukraine has big boobs and his other sister Belarus... Well, she loves her big brother Russia. 
 
That's right! She has the hots for Russia! 
 
INCEST! (RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT!) 
 
England is alright, and France is gay... I mean lovey-dovey (I meant his personality which I do have to say one thing... *RED ALERT SOUND* YAOI ALERT, YAOI ALERT!) HAHAHA! SOUND EFFECTS ARE SO FUN TO USE! 
 
HETALIA!  
 
The Soundtrack in the show ain't much, but due to the length of the show, there isn't much to say about the music in Hetalia, but there is one thing that does need to be said. The ending theme song. IS THAT THEME GONNA GET STUCK TO YOUR HEAD!? if you see the show long enough, this one WILL get stuck to your head. To make it more extreme, they made more than one version of the same song. It is a really catchy theme, now if you'll excuse me, I want to enjoy my tea and biscuits. 
 
HETALIA!   
 
As far as voice acting goes, The Subtitled Version is pretty good. The English Dub on the other hand is just as good. To my surprise, the script of the dub has the spirit of the Japanese script but has some slight script changes and a couple of added dialogue just for the American release. The Dub is funny and worth listening too. I am not saying the dub is better than the subs here but it does fit the show a little more. I think it all depends on preference. You can't go wrong with either version. I might as well mention the casting. Daisuke Namikawa and Todd Haberkorn are great as Italy. Hiroki Takahashi is great as Japan, Christopher Bevins also speaks good Engrish while voicing Japan. Hiroki Yasumoto is good as Germany while Patrick Seitz is fricking wunderbar as Germany. There are some worthy seiyus and Dub actors  to mention... Katsuyuki Konishi is fine as America, and Eric Vale plays a good stereotypical America. Masaya Onosaka is good as France and J. Michael Tatum surprisingly plays France way too damn well. Noriyaki Sugiyama and Scott Freeman are fine as Great Britian/United Kingdom/ England or whatever the bloody hell they call him. Yasuhiro Takato is alright as Russia but I love the ""Kolkolkol"" line he pulls off. Jerry Jewell is good as Russia as well. As far as some of the other extras, it was nice to hear Romi Park and Rie Kugimiya as Switzerland and Liechenstein. As far as The Dub goes, Chuck Huber was funny as Austria and Chris Sabat sounds like he had lots of fun playing Rome. 
 
I have to be perfectly honest. I prefer the dub of Hetalia a lot more than the subbed version for one particular reason. The accents for all the characters. The subtitled version is good, but it does miss the proper accents that the English Dub has. 
 
I am not an anime purist. I like watching anime on either English or Japanese, it makes no difference. I'm Bisexual... I mean Bilingual when it comes to anime. if you got a problem with it, I will smack you. 
 
(Narrator) Fun fact: The Fullmetal Cowboy is Straight. Okay... Was this necessary to even bring up in the first place? Oh right, it was to clarify that he was not bisexual. It was a joke on Francypants. 
 
HETALIA!  
 
Hetalia: Axis Powers is available from Funimation, The manga that came before the anime was available by Tokyopop but then got picked up by Right Stuf, so it is available. The Hetalia movie ""Paint It White"" and The second series ""World Series"" are also available by Funimation. I wonder if the discs were made in China. 
 
 
HETALIA!   
 
With all that said, Hetalia: Axis Powers is a funny show and to my surprise it has some educational value to it. It has quite a fanbase in The US, I went to Sakura-con just recently and noticed that there were a lot of people that liked the show, as far as demographics go. It seems that women like this show a little bit more than men do, but that didn't stop me from watching it. If there is one thing I don't like about this show... IT IS THE FAN BASE! *A Bunch of guns are pointed at my head, locked and loaded* Okay, okay... I'll admit that I do like the show, but I don't understand why a lot of people enjoy it so much. *Guns are put away*. If you want me to compare Hetalia's popularity, I can name just one show... one show that I would like to make a comparison. That one show is My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic... Now hold on for just one damn second! I know that these shows are obviously not similar to one another. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is super-popular and yet has a strong fan base, Hetalia is exactly that way too in the Anime Fandom. Here's an odd comparison of these two shows 
 
Hetalia = The characters are mostly male, and most of the fan base is female. 
 
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic = The characters are mostly female, and most of the fan base is male. 
 
If that isn't comparable, shoot me now... WAIT! I TAKE THAT BACK! 
 
(Some random person) ""Ha ha ha, you watch a show that's for little girls!"" 
 
KOL KOL KOL KOL KOL KOL KOL KOL KOL!!! 
 
HETALIA!  
 
Back to the topic... it is a funny show, you might like it... you might not. It's got funny characters, funny moments. The theme song is catchy as hell and the animation is okay for the most part. It would have made a great kids show if they dropped the swearing and some suggestive and sexual themes, but I guess it is what it is. I give Hetalia: Axis Powers a 7.5 out of 10, It is GOOD! 
 
Also, I like the TV show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. I think it is awesome and hilarious, so that obviously makes me a Brony. 
 
TO BE CONTINUED, Maybe...

    I first know about Hetalia from the issues about it in the internet. There's a LOT of Hetalia videos in YouTube, be it fan-works or official. I watched the first episode, and I found it extremely hard to understand, since it's so fast. After watching one or two episodes, I'm not really interested because it doesn't really make me laugh. So I stop watching for months. But when I was searching for new anime to watch, I choose this since I'm curious. So, now I'm extremely in love with this series. 
 
Story - 8 
Story-wise, it took place in WWII. But it doesn't have an exact plot. The plot continues until the 6th episode, and then after that the plot changed and became really... messed up. It can teach a REALLY small portion of history, but mostly are European History, so it's not helpful to me. But I like the story. Hetalia is an anime that focuses on stereotypical comedy, so plot doesn't really matter actually. 
 
Art - 7 
I like the art, but unfortunately, the art is not enough to make me laugh out loud. Of course, some parts are hilarious, but others are not. When I read the manga of the same part in the anime, honestly, I laugh more when I read the manga. The art doesn't show enough laughter. And the skin is very pale for some characters... 
 
Sound - 9 
I like the OSTs. It's simple, yet really displayed the character's characteristics, such as Italy's theme. It really showed Italy's culture in it. The voice acting is also good. They picked nice seiyuus to fill it up. But unfortunately, I think that the seiyuus are not being emotional enough. So it's kinda hard to pull out the laughter. The character songs are great though. They really displayed the harshness of history for some songs. 
 
Character - 10 
Character-wise, I LOVE it. Hima-sama really had a nice imagination. Non-human characters are common, but these characters are rare, since they are personifications of a country. Demon characters are really common, but you rarely saw an anime consists of personifications. Offensive stereotypes are relative and personal matters, so I'll leave it at that. 
 
Enjoyment - 10 
Whether you will like it or not is a personal matter. But, I will recommend you to watch this anime. I really enjoy this anime top to bottom. Sure there are some minor flaws, but nothing is perfect, you know? 
 
Overall - 9 
Overall, I LOVE it. First of all, I like this anime mostly about its creativity, and the characters. But, the art is not good enough to make me laugh... 
 
The rest? Watch it, and you'll know. :)

    Hetalia is an anime that is 5 minutes long every episode :D. The show has no continuing story, but is centered around the World Wars. It's basically about countries being real people and being portrayed as stereotypically as possible. The art is visually pleasing. Many things will be cute looking and they go into chibi mode frequently. The sound is awesome and so many character songs and the ending songs are so CATCHY:D. To tell you the truth there are going to be characters you will dislike,BUT there will be characters you love :D! Every character has their own personality and traits that some people will like and dislike. The show is full of only laughs and I highly ask you to watch the dub as you can hear every accent which Japan can't have mostly because we don't speak japanese and only speak differently with loudness or dialect. The fans of the show are also nice and friendly, so it has an awesome fan-base. Just watch out for all the yaoi you might find as yaoi fangirls love them pairings. I give this anime a 9.5/10 :D

    I first watched Hetalia way back in 2010, when it was recommend by a fellow anime fan who claimed it was the funniest anime she had ever seen. At first I was skeptical - the episodes were short, and I judged that with such short episodes it would therefore be just a bunch of really short jokes and choppy, rushed scenes. But I decided to give it a go nonetheless. 
 
At first it didn't fully grab my attention. For the first couple of episodes it was quite confusing and all over the place, leaving me baffled. However, right after episode five, I just started laughing. I couldn't stop. It was just so...so 'random' that it was hilarious. And I mean that in a good way.  
 
Let's first run over what Hetalia: Axis Powers is about. Hetalia is about countries that have been personified into people, and pokes fun at the many events throughout history. 
 
And that's it. That's what Hetalia is about. Might seem plot-less, but it's not meant to be an elaborate anime filled with plot-twists and surprises. It's there to make you laugh. And it does a very good job of that. But I'm not going to say it's not unique. Indeed, someone had a great imagination to actually think up the idea of personified countries. It is a very unique and wonderful idea, one I'm sure not many people have had. 
 
Now, in my opinion there are two types of people who've seen Hetalia - people who love it, or at least enjoy it; and people who hate it and call it a raciest joke for an anime. I'm, personally, apart of the people who obsess over it. And I'll say this about Hetalia - it taught me history and geography. Yes, it makes a huge joke of it, but it did teach me and inspire me to research history. Nowadays I know even more than my family about the countries of the world, all because I watched Hetalia. Hetalia is pretty factual, too, so kudos to that. 
 
In my opinion Hetalia is one of those rare animes where the dub is better than the sub. Honestly, the dub is just hilarious. Two seconds into the first episode it throws a World War Two joke in your face and a bunch of other references and cracks. The dub is also a lot more 'offensive' and does what the sub cannot - gives the characters' accents. That just adds to the laughs, even if the accents aren't always correct. Hetalia is set mostly during WW2, so you can also expect a lot of WW2 jokes that can be considered offensive. 
 
Funimation rated Hetalia TV-MA, yet I do not agree with that rating. Yes, there is a lot of swearing, and it does have a lot of ethnic humor that can be considered offensive; however a more appropriate rating would be TV-14 or even PG-13. (I apologize; I'm not familiar with American ratings. Over here in NZ it's rated M for Sexual References and Offensive Language. That's a good rating, in my opinion. Hetalia is definitely not meant for kids, but teens do watch it; it boosts their grades. ;D 
 
Hetalia plays on stereotypes and satire for a lot of the laughs. For example: America is obnoxious, annoying and loves his fast-food; England is a gentleman but can't cook if his life depended on it; France is a pervert; Italy is a pasta-loving fool; Japan and China have hilarious accents...and so on and so forth. Normally I hate stereotypes, but it's done purposefully and works for this anime, so I didn't mind it. 
 
The scenes and jokes actually flowed really well together too. It didn't seem rushed, and it worked well for the anime. So that's another bonus for the writers and the directors. 
 
Randomly off the subject, but Poland is my favorite character. He's just so awesome, with his valley girl accent. But back to the review. xD 
 
Overall, Hetalia's episodes are five minutes long so you won't be wasting precious moments of your life if you go and check it out. But give it a few episodes first. It can take a while to actually become understandable and truly hilarious, so if you haven't at least chuckled by episode five then you'll know whether Hetalia will be for you or not. And seriously, if you're failing in History, watch Hetalia. It should at least inspire you to research the subject. 
 
Now a lot of people ask me if Hetalia is raciest or not. In my opinion it's really how you look at the series. If you take history very seriously then Hetalia may offend you; however if you're looking for something comedic that will entertain you and hopefully boost your grades then go check it out. 
 
You may just end up liking it.

    This is by far one of the best animes out there!  
 
Every character is brilliant, funny and just down-right cute! Hetalia makes history fun and makes you love learning it! Did I mention the characters are cute?! 
 
Every character is molded perfectly with their own unique story to tell, and you can't help but love them all! 
 
It's just so entertaining and addictive that you find yourself wishing it just wouldnt end. I also love how this anime is a wonderful medium in bringing fans from all over the world! 
 
Viva world peace! Hetalia is one anime that is a must-watch!  
 
It's hilarious, it's educational and it's CUTE!

    Hetalia is one of my favorite anime. I guarantee you, it's different from what you've seen before. And you'll love it. 
 
Story: OMG, evry country is represented my a perdon! Starting with that original idea, Hetalia:Axis Powers not only shows II. WW, but also other historical events, as well as just random funny moments between characters. But even when it shows a fight, there isn't a single drop of blood. The allegory is strong, but somehow it shows history&geography in a funny way. The episodes don't reaaally have a stric storyline, so you can almost practicaly watch any random episode without seeing any spoilers. 10/10 
 
Art: The Chibitalia scenes are super-cute, but other thatn that there's nothing exceedingly special about it. 8/10 
 
Sound: Every (or almost every) country has a special, 30-second long ending, and those are amazing. They go with the series well, and more importantly they're hilarious and have a catchy tune, so don't be suprised if you find yourself singing along! And the sound effects are good, too. 9/10 
 
Characters: Hetalia's big thing!! The series takes the classin county  
stereotypes, but with an added twist, you'll end up loving them all! France is a womanizer who loves wine and hods a grudge against England, but when it comes down to it, they help eachother. Even Russia is somewhat comic, doing things his own way, with the help of his underlings, the Baltic counties (who, by the way, I have a huuuuge crush for) , and his siblings, the scary Belarus and the big-tit Ukraine. Amd even if this may sound like a lot of countries, you remember them al, and waait their hilarious new adventures. 10/10 
 
Overall enjoyment: Hetalia is special due to the fact that it has 5-minute episodesw, and therefore didn't air like a normal anime on TV, but instead in spread on the internet:). So whether you decide to have a full-day Hetalia marathon or just watch a few random episodes in-between studying, you'll be sure to laugh your head off (but there are times when it isn't only about comedy, but also emotions&feelings). So overall Hetalia is an anime that's deifinately worth your time, and one that you'll definately enjoy! 10/10

    Hetalia Axis Powers can be seen as racist since the characters are the stereotypical person from each country. My best friend (who is not on this website) hates it. I love this anime to death. Each episode is like 5 minutes each which can be annoying especially since I hate the ending song. Anyway, Axis Powers focusses on Germany, Japan, and Italy along with a few others but it is obvious that Germany, Japan, and Italy are the main focus. I found that Italy and his behavior are very, for lack of a better word, infectious to the view (well me). With his noodle arms in the air screaming ""Pastaa"" translated into my doing that whenever I heard someone talk about pasta and Italy. I can honestly say this anime ruined me (for the better of course). I'm not sure if there is an actual storyline here but I think there was. Axis Powers is really an anime to cheer you up. If you feel sad one day then this anime is just for laughs with Italy waving his white flag in surrender and screaming his love for pasta and seeing America acting the hero on the opposing side of Germany and friends. I would recommend it to anyone. The characters can be annoying which might be why my best friend hates it but I definitely recommend it.

        Aaaah! Hetalia, the oh so popular anime comedy where personafied countries do some random Shenanagains for around 5 minutes.  
     
    When I first saw the first 2 episodes in Japanese, I thought that the jokes were just dumb and random in a non-endearing way.  The ""tomato fairy"" thing seem just dumb. Then after a couple more episodes, I warmed up to the series and started liking it. I just found the Japanese Hetalia cute and harmless, afterall, it has a 5 min run per episode. When I checked out the English version however it wasn't that cute and harmless anymore. The humor is definately more offensive and vulgar and I personally think that it's more witty than the original, and I like hetalia even more thanks to the English version.  
 
     If you want an ""Oh, cute! Random countries are doing stupid stuff,"" show, Hetalia is for you. If you want a less vulgar Hetalia, check out the Japanese one. If you want the awesomely witty and offensive one, check it out in English.

    I will forever be ashamed that I ever liked this show.  
 
Plot: In this world, there are people who represent countries. Yeah. You read that right. People represent countries. That's all you need to know. There isn't a compelling story with intriguing and complicated plots and back stories. 
 
Art/Animation: Guys, this is 'Studio Deen'. Don't except a masterpiece and don't expect utter trash either. All I have to say is the animation was fluid. Not the best and the worst. 
 
Sound Department: The dub was fantastic. If you like offensive humor and accents you'll love this dub. The ending song was cute though. 
 
Characters: There isn't any character development. So all of you people liking that should drop this series. It's a comedy show guys. It's all about interactions between all of the quirky characters. They stereotype every single country in this. Italy is a coward and loves pasta. Germany is a military obsessed guy. You get the gist of it. 
 
Enjoyment: Way back when I enjoyed this series a whole lot. Now that I look back on this particular series I'm starting to get less and less excited about it. It's not just because of the series itself but it's also because one of my friend glorifies this anime and shoves her opinions down my throat. 
Even if my friend wouldn't do that I still would start to dislike this series. 
 
Overall: If you are offended easily you won't like this show. It's a nice show to watch and get a laugh out of it. 
It's nothing too complicated nor thought provoking. It's just a simple comedy series.

    Honestly, I never thought I'd get as addicted as I got when I decided to watch Hetalia. I never expected to be laughing as soon as I saw a world map or flags. Or crying when reading about the Revolutionary war. Yet here I am. Where have my life gone...  
 
I gave the story an nine. Since Hetalia revolves around historical events, it doesn't have a ""normal"" plot line. And it doesn't need one! It manage to tell history in such a humoristic way that it doesn't matter that it doesn't follow any red line. However, it can be a bit messy, jumping back and forth in history, thus the nine. 
 
The art isn't outstanding. Honestly, I don't really mind. I think it's fairly good and it doesn't draw too much attention from the characters personalitys and the story. However, since it's a bit too plain, I can only give it a seven. 
 
When it comes to the sound, let's go straight to the point. The voices. God, how I loved the voices! Both for the japanese version and for the english dub, the voices are truly amazing! I do recomend that you watch it dubbed though (which is rare, since I mostly prefer japanese). That is for one simple reason: the accents. The characters speaking with accents makes the show even more hillarious. I must warn you though. If it's your first time watching Hetalia; don't expect to hear what everyone says. They talk really fast. However, though it make take some time to get used to it, you will after a while. And when you actually hear the jokes, the show get's even funnier! Eight! 
 
The characters are the best part of Hetalia. They made the entire show. Yes, they are very overdone stereotypes and yes, they may seem offensive. And that's what's funny! Watching America yelling that he's the hero, England and France fighting and Italy being a pasta-loving coward is hillarious! All the characters are truly amazing and it's impossible to not find at least one likeable character! I'd rather say it's the opposite. You can't decide on only one...  I wish I could give them an eleven but I can't so I'll give them a ten! 
 
As for enjoyment, I have to give it a ten. I have never laughed so much watching a show. Also, the fact that the episodes are only five minutes each makes it easy to stop if you need to do something. Or continue to watch even if you need to do something... For me, who's very interested in histroy, the historical references and facts makes the show even more enjoyable. 
 
Overall I give Hetalia a nine out of ten. It's a truly amazing show. Yes it has some flaws, but it's still great. I highly recomend you watch it. But be aware! You will never look at the world the same way again...

    Hetalia Axis Powers i a anime that is enjoyable to a lot of people. It is funny and teaches you a lot about history. The subbed is good and the english dubbed is also good. theres popular voice actors is the english dubbed and they even add the accents of the countries. If you get offended of people stereotyping countries then this anime is probably not for you. 
 
1) The story goes all over the place from WW1 to WW2. There really isn't a story other then the time periods are different. 
 
2) Art is Hetalia is vary cute and the anime does a good job by making the countries lovable/ adorable. In some of the latter stories the characters get a makeover and the art changes. 
 
3) Overall this anime can be enjoyed by many and you may learn some interesting facts about the earth. This is a great comedy that you should give a try. 
 
If you agree or disagree then send me a comment. I love hearing everyones feedback about these kind of topics.

    Hetalia to me was a very good anime with very interesting characters. The quantity and diversity of the characters makes the anime enjoyable and fun. Art and sound were good i won't complain about that. The only i didn't like is the story and how they show the episodes. It's too random! Sometimes u can't tell what's going on. Also the episodes are waaaaay too short that fact all makes it hard tro understand whats going on. Overall is if you enjoy history and fun characters then you'll enjoy Hetalia Axis Powers.

    (This is going to be a really long review) 
This show wasn't my first anime. I had watched Fairy Tail and others of the same caliber before. However, this was the show that actually got me into anime. This show is the reason I made so many of the friends I have. It's easy to criticize this show and bash it for not having absolutely perfect art and story, but I rate it a 10 because of how much it's changed me and how much it's changed so many people. My life would be completely different from what it is now. It's brought so many people together. 
 
Yes, the art style is minimal. Yes, it is often pure fanservice. Yes, the jokes get old fast. But at the end of the day, we all still love Hetalia.

    PASSSTAAAA!? 
 
If you're not entertained when a person says that in front of you in an Italian accent, I don't think you'll enjoy this show too much. 
Hetalia Axis Powers embodies countries into one person, personifying their culture, past and the individuality of its citizens (or at least how the rest of the world sees their citizens...) 
 
Story (6) 
What story? There's really no hint of it, it goes back and forth in history. Though as far as I know, when they're actually retelling history they're actually correct on their facts. The best thing about this show is the numerous amount of historical jokes, political jokes and cultural gags of the different nations on the show. 
 
Art (8) 
It's cute and bright, its interesting and every character looks different. Their character models also add to their individual personalities, so it deserves quite a bit of applause. You can easily tell some of their character by only looking at their reactions, body language, etc. 
 
Sound (7) 
Catchy ED/OP and character ED's that are spread out through the series are quite enjoyable, even if they're only different versions of the same song. 
 
Character (9) 
All of them are interesting, lovable and funny. I enjoy watching all of them interact with each other and the show kept me laughing, though it does take time to fully understand all the jokes about the individual countries. However by about half-way point, you can easily understand the jokes that are thrown back and forth about the different nations. 
 
Overall: 
Its funny and I totally enjoyed it, it made me interested in history again. It would be amazing if this was the way people were taught history, but that's sadly on a dream. Its an enjoyable and short comedy (only 5 mins per episode), however some of the jokes depend on a little of background knowledge on the countries. However besides that, please enjoy this marathon of laughs!

    Imagine a comedic anime in which every character represented an entire country while WWII is breaking out. Now imagine that they’re all extremely stereotypical and also hilarious, and almost every country has a complicated and rather silly relationship with the other countries—all portrayed in bite-sized five-minute episodes—and you have Axis Powers Hetalia. 
 
The leading three characters are of course Italy, Germany, and Japan (the Axis Powers), with the Allies holding pointless meetings and working out (generally incompetently) what to do, while other countries work their angles. 
 
Some of the lines and ideas in this anime are superb: “I’ve loved you since the 900s,” Holy Roman Empire says to Italy; “I wonder when it will be my turn to talk,” Canada whispers hopefully; “I can never tell what Japan is thinking,” Germany grumbles; the Trembling Trio of Baltic States under Russia, etc. 
 
In addition, it’s great for learning history, if you don’t mind the fact that nothing is taken seriously or off limits to criticism. (Plus, Romi Paku is Switzerland!) 
 
Also, apparently there’s quite a bit of controversy about this anime. I suggest you avoid it if you can’t take your country being portrayed poorly, disrespectfully, or not at all.

    First off, you shouldn't watch the anime or read the manga if you get offended easily or don't want to be offended. 
 
Hetalia is one of those animes where you just can't enough of!Well since its 5 minutes long, don't let that fool you though! This anime is great in many ways. Two good reasons are, one its downright funny and second it teaches you about history. 
Face it. You tried studying once, and hated it. It doesn't matter which subject. Hetalia Axis Powers more on WWI and WWII. You should try and watch this, maybe you'll learn something~

    I don't get it.......why is this anime so good? It boggles my mind every time i think about this question. There is no actual story, the animation isn't that great and most of the character are stereotypes(plus a male tsundere) yet there is a huge fanbase around it. So i watched this anime for curiosity's sake. i finally understand why its so good. The jokes, the references, and the funny and stereotypical characters( what else do you expect from humanized countries? Yes, you saw that correctly. HUMANIZED. COUNTRIES. Countries like America, and Italy as stereotyped humans. Crazy, right? well Hidekaz Himaruya made it work. I love this anime to death, give it a watch i dont care if you didn't like just watch a few episodes and you will see what i mean.

    What if countries were personified as people? This is the premise of this cute little series. 
 
The main character is Italy, he's adorable, the textbook definition of innocence. Annoying but endearing clinginess to other countries. 
 
Very stereotyped characters. Not much substance to them. The story is pretty basic, just the characters messing around to the vague plot of WW1 and 2, pure filler. 
 
Devoid of any substantial plot, but unbelievably entertaining. Just mindless cuteness and hilariousity. But insanely fun nonetheless. 
 
Each episode is only five minutes, which adds to the uniqueness and simplicity of the show. Very easy to knock out three or four at a time. Or one on the go if you need a quick smile or two. 
 
The art style is pretty basic, focusing on the more adorable side more than serious, which is perfect for this type of basic premise. Half of the time the characters are in chibi-mode. Adding to the charm of this show.

    This animation is by far my favorite, mainly due to its historical background, that deals with history and culture alike. I am a huge History geek and It was unbelievably fun way to learn about history. For those who do not think of it as a History animation, I can give you one tip. The true history is in the detail, and if you are a true history nerd like me you will notice it straight away. Like ""rock those shorts like a hugo boss"" mainly because german nazi soldiers were made by hugo boss, or when  america come in super late during war in Africa and claiming they won, when England already won it themselves. Therefore I believe it is a very accurate anime that shows history in the most fun and enjoyable way. 
 
The animation at the begining was quite meh, but then it actually developed really well in the newer series, which were more appealing hehe 
 
The sound, I personally prefer the english dub, mainly due it having the accents right for each country, and that you can learn a few words and sentences in the given language, mainly Spanish german japanese French and Italian. Also I found the english voice actors much more funnier and nicer to listen to, especially Romano Prussia Spain and England. 
 
The characters represent the countries sterotypically, many are faulty like poland and finland in my opinion, but the rest is quite accurate at least sterotypically wise haha They have an indepth and more complex personalities, were england sees unicorns and faires, italy has anxiety and paranoia? and russia has a some weird bi-polar disorder, in general I enjoy the series as they are short, each episode is 5 minutes long. They kept me entertained and are nice to rewatch, I might have rewatched them so much that I know most quotes from it haha but yeah this is my Number 1 anime and I highly recommend! well unless ur over sensitive with Italy being fascist and germany a nazi, or maybe u get offended by how your country is portrayed then no do not watch it XD

    This anime in context is a fun and easy going series that latches and explains past events as well as simplifying relationships between countries to make them easier to understand. 
 
Story: 7 
The story is typically a restructured plot of events such as World War Two and the Axis collaboration between Germany, Japan and the main 'character' Italy (Italia). Although some areas such as explaining more on the different events and who and what led to the beginning of that could have been more included in the storyline, I found that this story was much more well rounded that I would have thought it would be, purely because it allowed the audience and watchers to know what was going on without having to research again and again on what terms meant or why someone was fighting against another person. Relationships were well thought out whilst also sticking to who was allies with whom in the real world. 
 
Art: 7 
Sticking to the original author's art and style (I think it was a webcomic?), the way that Hetalia was animated somehow seemed to combine old animation techniques with new ones as the character and background designs stayed superficial and drawing like while the features of the characters definitely had relations to old styles and new styles together. The way that the characters moved also portrayed movements that were less fluent that perhaps recent animations such as Violet Evergarden which displays more realistic joint movements.  
 
Sound: 7 
The opening and ending song where the ending song had numerous versions were quite catchy and upbeat which surprised me when I listened to them as I originally would have thought that the tune would be annoying due to the 5 minute marking of each episode in the series itself. 
However, what somewhat bought the mark down for sound were the voice actors and the sound effects. Sound effects were nothing extraordinary and pretty average in my opinion and many of the voice actors wounded the exact same for some of the characters. 
 
Character: 8 
To be honest, not much is needed to be said about characters as the relationships and portrayal of each country was pretty accurate and if not still provided humour towards the audience. As the story pretty much focuses on  the prime relationships between Germany and Italy, it gave a sweet outlook on their relationships and their positions towards each other (well this might just be me being a fujioshi) An eight for characters! 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Personally I enjoyed this series quite a lot and would probably watch it again for entertainment or as a side series to rewatch 
 
Overall: 7 
I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining anime to follow and the short timing of each episode is also easy to follow!

         My friend was telling me about this anime for years and after annoying me forever I decided to give it a try, I wasn't expecting much because I love detailed animation and dimensional characters like in Miyazaki's works. I can't explain why but I LOVE THIS ANIME! Hetalia is by no means a show for every one but it really struck a cord with me as did the other seasons, while this is defidently the weakest of the Hetalia seasons it's still a very enjoyable anime as a guilty pleasure and a quick watch. The episodes are five minutes which I feel is a bit to short but that's not too big of a problem for me. 
 
STORY: 8 
     The story in Hetalia is, well, to be honest it's all aover the place but they can get away with this due to Hetalia's short time. I found myself entertained when I was watching an laughed at a lot of the jokes which reminded me of something like South Park where at moments the story is serious but most of the time it's rude, immature and just plain ridiculous which like with South Park it's done very well so I liked them.  
 
ART: 6 
    The art of Hetalia is fair at best, this is the weakest aspect of the show as the animation leaves something to be desired. The characters don't look awful but the backgrounds are primative and look like something I could draw at the age of twelve. The colors are nice and bright and the animation becomes bether as the seasons go on and I'm really enjoying the new style they have given the show. I give the art a pass for some nice character designs. 
 
Sound: 8  
     The dub of this show is one of my personal favorties and possibly one of the only anime where I would reccomend the dub and not the subtitles. Each country is given an accent which really sets them apart. 
 
Characters: 8 
     The characters of this show are mostly hillarious, my personal favorites being America, Italy and Russia. The countries are sterotypical but hillarious although if you are easily offended you may want to skip this anime all together. 
 
Overall for me personally I love this series and would highly reccomend it but it's not the greatest thing as a lot of people claim it is.

    Hetalia is one of those shows that's so bad, it's good. It's one of those shows that you watch when you have nothing better to do. With the fantastic concept of personified countries, I wish they actually would have made a story out of it instead of random, nonsensical skits. Some of the jokes were bad, but it's entertaining enough.  
Common misconceptions about Hetalia: 1. It teaches you history. No, it doesn't. Yes, it does base some of the skits off of real historical facts, but it doesn't really teach you anything. 2. Hetalia is racist and offensive. It's not hard to believe that a show about stereotypes would have some people complaining. Although it does make fun of some countries, it doesn't get to the point that it's actually offensive. 
Overall, Hetalia isn't worth your undivided attention, but if you're really bored one day, it's mildly entertaining.

    Might as well quit history lessons for watching this (Don't take it seriously)! Hetalia is a fun combination from historical reality (or semi-reality) and pure comedy.  
 
Characters represents a country (or a micro-nation in some cases) who are seen as having a stereotypical nature. 
 
Each 5-minute episode explains events (or just shows complete randomness) in a fashion that it's actually enjoyable to learn. 
 
I like the simple art that Hidekaz drew and the soundtrack fits perfectly with every simple part (especially episode 17). 
 
Laughing is very common when watching this! 
 
DUB Review : It's not simply a alternative! It's a totally different way of dubbing. Now with more comedy, stereotypes and most of all, accents. 
 
In conclusion, I was rather hooked when seeing this. The only moment when you're dissapointed is when you finish this series (unless you plan on watching this again)

    I enjoyed this anime a lot, however, in my opinion the artstyle and story isn't the best. I'm aware they have changed the art style to a lot more colourful one which I love and this anime uniquely makes the almost nonexistent story enjoyable. It's stereotypical and I love it. I'm Canadian and I more fall into the lumberjack stereotype but seeing that they went with the quiet stereotype is quite enjoyable. Wonder what it would be like to have a lumberjack stereotype.... 
The characters are enjoyable. My personal favourites are Prussia, Italy, Romano, The Nordics and a few others scattered around the series. This anime made me actually enjoy history class as I imagined Prussia and Austria fighting to the death. However, I put my own twist to it and made Austria die from a whol army of Gilbirds.  
The voice acting is stereotypical and again, I love it. I'm usually butthurt when I see people shitting on Canadians because of false stereotypes but Hetalia does it in a way that I love and wanna see more people shitting on my country (Hetalia characters, not real life XD). I love the comedy of this anime and it's a comedy that's actually good. Those are hard to find these days and a lot of the time it's simple people for icing the,selves to say something funny or saying 'Deez Nuts' or 'Ma Name Iz Jeff' thinking they are funny. Hetalia, Hetalia should be the new...shut up me. I don't even...BLAH 
 
I recommended this to my friends and I don't think I can explain how my German friend felt whenever she learned that the buff main character was Germany. She almost fangirled as much as she does when she sees Yato. 
 
I've heard of many people who've dropped this anime, and I don't care. This anime is the type of anime where it's either you hate it or you love it. You really just need to have good humour tastes in the humour this show uses. From childish to just plain dirty the jokes in this show are pretty promising. They have some pretty good references and some of my favourite however aren't even in this anime, but in Hetalia:The Beautiful World. These two references are ""I Wonder Which Of The Four Houses You Were Sorted Into?"" (Slytherin, Grryfindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw) and something talking about girly ponies (My Little Pony). It's an amazing anime and in my opinion gets better each season. I highly recommend it if you are confident in your humour.  
 
Good day my fellow hetalians

    In Hetalia we can easily say there's no original story since it's all about past events based on historical events  involving more or less nation, but what's great about it are how those events are depicted... 
Did i mention that each nation is personified by one of them, each with its typical stereotype and clichè? Italia Veneziano (the northern part) is a merry-go-round PASTAAing everywhere focusing on women and, of course, pasta. Nippon is a serious boy that reveals himself as an otaku, Germany is a dutifl guy who loves Wursts and potatoes and so on with all the others; everyone of them is just Epic in its own way. Animations are always colorful and without particular demands, not too great and not too shabby, they're good just the way they're since that's the last of your worries. Musics are simply great and there're songs for every occasion that fits every nation and how they interact with events and/or the others charas. The only problem may be each episode length since it's not a regular anime we're blabbering about and maybe if someone doesn't have an open mind and takes it too seriously, but i'm sure a try wouldn't surely hurt yourself unless you fall down the chair or experiencing a breath loss due to the laughing XD

    Holy wow, did I enjoy that anime :D 
This seriously got me more interested in history now. I am failing horribly at my world history class just cause I was simply not interested in what happened in the past, but this anime right here gave me a whole new perspective. I have a feeling I'm going to do a lot better in my class thanks to this. 
 
Story - 8 
It really does tell history in a different perspective so I enjoyed it. However, it didn't really tell me why Germany, Italy and Japan were the best of friends until my sister told me those three countries went and killed a lot of people back then and that's why the series was called Axis Powers. o-0 If this show is rated for teens, I don't think it would be so bad to at least tell us why these countries hate/like each other. But overall I loved the story telling. 
 
Art - 10 
Very nice art styles on the different countries. I am Chinese, so I was very pleased on how correct Chinatown looked like in the series. Glad to see they weren't stereotypical in art. 
 
Sound - 10 
In the intro and ending songs/themes were the best, always cheering me up and getting me ready to watch the episodes. The music in the anime is also very interesting, I love it. 
 
Character - 9 
Very funny characters, and stereotypical too but that's what makes it funny xD. However I believe they got a few characters wrong like Italy, because Italy really isn't the kind of country that's a coward…But the characters are still great; lively for the show! The accents were also the best XD I loved them! 
 
Enjoyment - 10 
Gave me a new look on history so that definitely helped me! I loved Axis Powers.

    This is obviously over-hyped and far from what I can call good. The reason why I even gave this series a 7 is the idea. Ideas are expensive. Aside from the very  brilliant, incredible yet creative concept of personifying all these countries (I can't deny that I do write and read dark,historically accurate fanfictions of Hetalia, or Hetalia AU where they are not depicted as contries but I don't really watch the entire series, I am only a huge fan of the concept and the characters), the whole series is not historically accurate (I know this is intended to be a parody but well..) and the art makes me want to bawl (seriously, can't you work more on the animation, at least?). The first 11 episodes were good, but I dropped it halfway. The stupidity (the songs are my guilty pleasure though), the romanticization of warfare and unforgivable crimes of humanity (I am being dead serious here), and the dangerous stereotypes of the countries are overwhelming (why dangerous? I'm sure this show is targeted to people who haven't even touched, let alone read, accurate history book in their lives and only skim the first two paragraphs from wikipedia) This anime actually has all the potentials to become publicly famous (not only among anime fans) if it isn't for all of those aforementioned things. And lastly, I'm not commenting like this because I'm an International Relations student who is rather familiar with the history of the world and international politics, but I'd like to emphasize on the fact that I'm convinced any educated person will find this show cringe-worthy.

    I watched all of Hetalia: Axis episodes and I think it has been a month since I got into this fandom. Did I regret it? No. Being a geography geek and a comedy junkie, I find this show very enjoyable. Now let me have my review in this series. 
 
Story: 7/10 
 
My review only covers the first two seasons of Hetalia. The World Series and The Beautiful World will have their separate reviews later. 
 
This can be quite educational since it frequently tackles world history using anthropomorphic bishonen nations and animate it in the least harmful manner. Hidekaz has a knack for screwing historical events in the most hilarious way possible and man, this is potent comedy gold formula for the first two seasons. If the Second World War could be ended using a wonk, you know that this is going to be an insanely funny series. 
 
Unfortunately, this is not the case at all times. Hetalia is less funny when it focuses on cultural stereotypes and goes Azumanga Daioh with the quirks of its characters. These are still funny (the episode with England, Russia and Busby's chair left me laughing) but the racist reference will irk some of the viewers.  
 
Hilarious humor aside, this has also guts to pull some emotional moments which will give you pleasant surprise. The story of Switzerland and Liechtenstein is particularly one of the more moving anime episodes I have watched (It is an achievement since we are in Hetalia universe where humor is the highest priority and proper plot is secondary). Also poignant is the story on how America attained his independence from England. These are sparse but will leave a mark to the viewer since these are really good Hetalia episodes. 
 
Chibitalia, however, failed to deliver comedy and sentiment until the last episode where the Holy Roman Empire decided to leave Italy.  The segment with Granda Rome didn't garner laughs either. As regards to Chibitalia, I can understand where the fangirls are coming from since one of its segment's scenes crossed from homoerotic teasers to pure shounen ai fluff. 
 
The story is not linear as it jumps from the Medieval to the present so there is no exact plot line for Hetalia. You will not mind it if you are solely watching for the laughs but it will make you wish for anything deeper in this series later. 
 
Art: 6/10 
 
Art is not exactly the strongest point of Hetalia save for some smart use of hues in some scenes. Aside from Germany, Japan, England and Italy, all other nations look the same. Some of them are rather drawn crudely which is a sign that Studio Deen is on a tight budget when they made this series. Nonetheless, it is not that glaring that it affects your watching experience.  
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
Marukaite Chikyuu in particular is one of the catchiest anime songs I have heard so far despite running for only thirty seconds. The use of the background music in this series is scarce but effective to highlight the humor. Oh, listening to every character's Marukaite Chikyuu is highly recommended if you are that immersed as a Hetalia fan. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
 
Given that the plot is really thin (since it sometimes forgets to screw history and just portray stereotypes) and heavily relies on character interaction, this is where Hetalia shines and kicks all other bishonen based comedies out of the competition. Ranging from the painfully polite Japan to the simply crazy Belarus, the characters make up for the lack of a proper plot in Hetalia.  Do you want characters with wacky personalities which are endless source of lol-worthy moments? Hetalia has all of them. This is my personal opinion but Germany in particular should be with Italy at all times for your humor intentional or not. England's cynicism is also a good source of laughs especially when with America or France. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
 
A comedy is made to laugh. Hetalia, fulfilled its task easily despite running for five minutes per episode. This is not the best show you will see and your mileage may vary with its homoerotic undertones and racist cultural reference but give it a shot. This is one of the funnier series of late 2000s.

    Basically, the anime is about abunch of Countries as people. It's a pretty simple idea, but it's actually quite good. Plus, with the large amount of characters, you know you will be able to find atleast one character you will like. Although, this anime is abit racist, so it is not for the easily offended, but it's all jokes and stuff, nothing serious. This anime itself really isn't serious, actually. I mean- it's an online comedy series with only afew minutes to each episode. Even if it is simple, it's addicting. Hetalia is addicting. You end up easily watching 20 episodes in a day. The main thing that bothers me is all the yaoi and shounen-ai fangirls. I like shounen-ai, but they kind of make couples that would just be wrong or not even possible. Other then that, I reccomend this for basically anyone.

    First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story – inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio – is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

    This is a genuinely intelligent and well-told story that happens to have huge amounts of fan service.  The contrast between the emotional depth of the character development and the overwhelming objectification of the sex was jarring to me, but I'm quite addicted to this series and I can't give it up.

    I gave this show an 8 in rating because it did something Season 1 didn't.  It got to the meat of the main two characters relationship early.  Too many times there are rom/coms that are great stories and wonderful shows but the relationship side doesn't happen until 3 episodes to the end of the entire series leaving you wanting to know what happened in the end. An example of this is Toradora.  The show was outstanding.  Art superb, Story awesome, Characters wonderful.  I loved every minute of it but you never found out how it all ended.  You had to assume it was a happily ever after.  It was the same with My Little Monster  ZnT:KnF gave you a great idea where they stand early on and then ends so strong with the final two episodes of the season being emotionally moving.  I just started the rom/com genre and if other shows have this formula then I will really enjoy this genre.  Now, don't get me wrong...They still have a lot more to flesh out before I am happy with the final ending but with the pace this show is going, I'm sure I won't be disappointed at all.

    For those who thought that this was not as good as the first season, they are definitely wrong. This is just as good if not even better thanks to the last episode. They really didn't develop the character stories as much and the story slowly progressed without much movement but it was still quite good. The last episode was really good with the emotional setup but I would have changed the ending.

    I don't hate Zero No Tsukaima but I can hardly say it's a masterpiece.  
Were to start? The best place would be the story.  
 
The story is about the struggles of a boy Named Saito summoned into a rigid society were the lower classes are oppressed. Were he fights for his master ""Louise"" in a world with many wars whilst searching for a way to return back to his world whilst also being conflicted by his love for ""Louise"". Evil also plots the down fall of this world. Sounds cool, no?  
Well alas that's not how it turned out its basically a harem set in a hogwartsin the middle of who knows where. There loads of deep plots the story could follow but alas it just turns into your typical harem set in a magical world. It doesn't take it's self seriously and I would be cool with that if it didn't want to take it seriously. Yes it's true a tear may be jerked but I can't help think about pedophilia ambitions of Saito. it's not original and when given chances to be individual and original it spits it back into your face and says ha I would prefer to be a harem fest.  
But that's enough ranting for now. 5/10 
 
The sounds solid I can say that much The op was better than last season because it didn't ruin the whole plot in about2 minutes of footage. The ED was also much better but the ost is lack lasted. So it all comes down to a mediocre score of 5/10  
 
I'm kinda too lazy to do an eno osu rant on the characters but let me say this.  
Saito is a mugal with special abilities but also has an intense obsession for brests and chaseing after woman. On an intresting point he tries to keep to a no class system, yet this idea is never explored.  
Louise is your typical tsundere character that loves the main character. But she almost seems yandere with vicious attutide however she's rather lacklustre in the fact the her character develops but she just seems to goes in circles. 
Siesta is a bitch in season one you could connect with her for being the poor plebeian that's working hard. However she just becomes a manipulative bitch in season 2 and that's due to her bing designed like that.  
Am I missing anyone important nope the rest are reall character fillers or harem bait etc.  
But as harem bait job accomplished 5/10  
 
Watch it yourself to see if you enjoyed I did to some degree but it's for you to decide.  
 
Overall should you watch?  
I don't really care go ahead I'm just using this review to rant about how this anime just had too much and I mean way too much harem than needed.  
 
5/10

    2nd season of Zero no Tsukaima is not as bad as it's first season. I personally think that the 2nd season is better than the first.. 
 
The Story, it obvious Zero no Tsukaima had a very stupid storyline chucked in with cute characters and etc. In fact, the plot is the totally messed up, or even worst, theres no plot to the story, it's totally about saito and louise's love and how they mate each other =O 
 
Art's not bad, I liked it. Probaly one of the strong point of Zero no Tsukaima. Characters are well drawn, although I prefer the manga version, which far more kawaii than the anime version x3 
 
The sound are fine, although there are room for improvement on it. Actually of all the 3 season of Zero no Tsukaima, I liked this season's opening the most, motivated by some parts of the show heh heh heh.  
 
Characters are 50/50 to me, some are good, some are bad. The main reason for me to watch this show's because of louise and saito, louise's one of the best tsundere I ever seen before.. Saito is not bad though, although i really hate his pervert-ness, blah. Siesta is just.. irritating!! The bad guys is just.. retarded. Forget this show if you are expecting some big action from the bad guys because they can't do a shit at all. 
 
Enjoyment is... again, mixed. I can say nearly half of the episode are enjoyable, and the other half is not. The only worthwhile to watch this showto me is in fact... episode 4 and 12.. probably that the only 2 episode that made this season a good season.. otherwise I would rate this as 4 instantly. Siesta is such a annoying ass, why does she have to show up and ruin up the lovely atmosphere between saito and louise? Arghh!! I can't believe shes a character in the anime made to purely destroy your enjoyment (and make louise jealous).  
 
Well in overall, it's not bad... you got to watch the last episode though.. It's epic and you will never regret it, that episode (along with episode 4) drags the score up, I'll give it a 9!!

    --MY FIRST REVIEW. PLEASE BARE WITH ME-- 
 
Story: I felt like the first season had more story into it. The second season had plenty of fillers, in my opinion. In the begginning, it was okay. Nothing was really happening. The story picked up abit in the middle. Near the end, however, it became more exciting, but there were some parts of it that you could have lived without. The ending of the last episode was touching, until the moment got ruined, but I'll let you guys figure that out, I wouldn't want to spoil for those hardcore fans. 
 
Art: I enjoyed the art in this anime, it was very nice, and easy on the eyes. The designs were simple, yet they are excellent and appropriate for this kind of anime. Think about it, this is an anime that is surrounded by magic. You wouldn't want to see overdone graphics that makes it look worse, dispite the fact that it would be fully detailed and would have so much going on. 
 
Sound: Exceptional sound. Good magic sound effects. I think the begginning and ending was a nice touch. I didn't get tired of listening to them both. 
 
Character: The characters developed in good ways, than others. Louise became slightly more consious of her feelings towards Saito, she became more jealous, and has an ability of a magic that was thought to never exist. Saito, on the other hand, has become more of a pervert than I would have liked him to. His chest obsession has put me in positions where I became frusturated with him because of his growing perveted ways. The other characters such as Siesta and the princess became more developed in this anime, and are adding on to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: Saito pretty much killed half of my enjoyment, his growing pervertedness just ruins it for me. But I would like to say that I enjoy ZnT alot, and the third season doesn't look as bad. 
 
Overall: I would have given this a 7.5 if I could. This is an anime series worth watching. I would highly reccomend it for people who are open in the idea of a magical/slightly Harry Potter-ish anime with a good story, humor, fanservice GALORE, and interesting characters.

    The second season of zero no tsukaima poses a diffrerent story from the first whereby a battle is being fought between two major parties creating another epic battle towards the end of the series, with a similar cast and a few new entries. 
 
The story was better than the first in my opinion, because it moves at a slightly faster pace not having to introduce too much on the characters. There's an even greater amount of romance in this series as well as drama. Again as the first it does not feature your cliched magic school academy in fact, it moves further away from that in the second series and focuses more on the war that breaks out. 
 
The art was the same as the first so there int really much i have to say about the art of the series, other than it was flawless but not exceptional. 
 
I personally loved the opening of this series it was so touching and sentimental, but again no insert songs(not that i remember), had there been any it would have left a deep impression on me since the drama and romance was much more significant in this series. 
 
The characters carry on from the first story wth a few new ones coming in, for an anime with only 12 episodes i think they managed to give some depth to the new characters by focusing on them in certain episodes. In this series the relationship between Louise and Saito is brought out more and a level higherand this is especially evident towards the end of the series which was quite touching and sentimental, also there is a new couple which i won't spoil for you. 
 
I definitely enjoyed this season if not more than the first, the comedy still prevails to quite a good level which does not interfere or make the story lok childish. Even at the end, i found it quite hilarious and suitable ending to the series, of course there are some questions that are left unanswered, but the fact that a third season is coming out already solves that problem. 
 
Overall, The season was better than the first as they did not have to spend episodes introducing the characters again, however, as said of the first season, the series should be made longer as it lacks depth in some areas, but seeing that it is meant to be a romantic comedy its ok that there is a lack of seriousness in some cases, yet the true story is still brought out well with a good balance in the serious and comical side of the show, no doubt if you loved the first you will definitely enjoy this series.

    Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, the sequel to the previous season is the continuation of the epic saga of Saito Hiraga and Louise Valliere.  
 
The invasion of Tristain has been pushed back thanks to Louise and Saito and an ueasy calm settles over the land. Louise begins to practice Void Magic while Saito, having given up his chance to go home to Japan, tries to find ways to fill his time. But the wars are not over. The peaceful lull is but the calm before the storm, and soon Queen Henrietta must make a terrible choice between a temporary peace and a preemptive invasion of Albion. Either way, Tristain is soon to be embroiled in war once more, and “Zero” and her Familiar will be right in the middle of it. 
 
The story is relatively new in some ways. New characters are introduced like pretty boy Julio Chesare, headstrong Agnes Chevalier de Milan, nasty Eleanor and precious Cattleya Valliere, and finally the seductive Sheffield. The continuation of the story is pretty new and brings a new sense of adventure in the series. I must admit though, Louise seems much more colorful and bright in personality compared to the last season with a black-and-white personality and obviously annoys some viewers at times.  
 
But the lackluster it holds is the lack of character importance for previous ones like Kirche, Tabitha, Montmorency, and Guiche. Some of them are just completely forgotten, hardly even referred to at times. The whole series mostly focuses not only on Saito and Louise's feisty relationship, but more on Agnes' past and her ambitions to avenge her past along with the mysterious history behind Mr. Colbert himself. 
 
Even if this was lacking in more story content, at least it made up for having some complexity in the plot, with some dramatic feelings in that one pivoting moment for Agnes to figure out what really happened in the past. This compensates that Zero no Tsukaima really isn't a two-dimensional show, it's got some good stuff in it. Even the pace to this anime is very smooth and flows perfectly along with the humor that includes Saito's naughty pleasure in cleavage and romantic comedy.  
 
The animation and art were good and very consistent. Background music was not the most impressive but it was pretty decent. Voice acting was good as usual, so I have to give props to the studio for at least making sure it continues to look and sound good.  
 
Honestly, season 2 starts off pretty much routine—and then I found it hard to sit through. First off, the relationship angle is fine between Saito and Louise—no problems, but the storyline seemed lack luster from the first. Maybe I expected too much. With the addition of newer characters—I had hope such like Julio and Louise’s Siblings. Fortunately—the last part was the only good part about it.The last scene was the critical moment in the season...not much to say but it's just a visualization of how beautiful Saito and Louise's love is.  
 
I give Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi a score of 9 because of how good it was to connect the series as a sequel. It left me a great feeling of satisfaction to once again to be worth my time to watch this. As I am a fan of romantic anime, this is probably one of my favorites to keep on to. Once again, this is yet not failed to disappoint me ever!

    Loved the characters. 
 
Hated the direction the director took in making the series. 
 
It's like they tried too hard to mix rom-com and action-adventure, and they ended up with a bland concoction  that appeals to neither fans of either genre. They should have just picked one and used the other as a supplement. 
 
Including season 1, we're currently 25 episodes into the series. So far, there are far too many crucial questions that have been left unanswered, such as: What is a Void mage? Why is it important? Why was Saito chosen as the reincarnation of Gandalfr? Why is Louise the only Void mage to appear in centuries? Why now, as opposed to 10 years ago or 10 years into the future?  
 
Back story aside, let's look at current questions: Has Louise made any progress as a Void mage? Has Saito learned to harness his inner power?  
 
Important development questions like these are left unanswered, nor are they shown. We don't see either characters making progress. In an anime like Zatch Bell, we see definitive progress being made -- When Zatch improves through battle, we know he improved because we SEE him learning a new skill that are later actively used. Louise has a book of Void Magic. We see her use it once, and that's it. Has she learned any new skills or progressed further into the book? We dont know, because it's not shown. 
 
Other characters who are seemingly important actually end up having little to no relevance at all. When Julio was introduced as the 3rd member of Team Zero, I thought, ""Awesome, another character to finally add some dynamic"". Instead, he's been useful exactly twice, had maybe 1/10th the amount of lines even Siesta had, and hardly played a relevant role. No development with him is made, or shown on screen. 
 
Instead, silly scenes with Siesta are shoved on screen on practically every episode, despite it not furthering the series in any productive ways, and the plot dealing with the war is just dashed in as a side story.  
 
As stated at the start, I love the characters. Louise is like a magical version of Taiga from Toradora, and I love that. Saito is a perverted high schooler, who acts the part very nicely, though, it does get old once you see him doing the same thing (and getting beat for the same thing) an over abundant amount of times because the directors just can't seem to decide on what they want.  
 
That said, I still did enjoy the series, but these criticisms just keep me from giving it a high score. The series had so much potential and it really makes me sad that it's been squandered away.

    1st season was better. 
 
No matter how good improvement the animation of this season is, the story must take precedence. 
 
The characters became a bit perverted, from my notice, compared to the 1st season. the hero tries advances to girls that would haven't been done in the previous season. the heroine blushes to some handsome character, suddenly helpless against stranger's advances. both demeans the encounter, moments and experience they had on season 1. 
 
though the comical side is still good, the characters were changed if not destroyed for the sake of the story. If they were to remain unchanged, it is apparent they take up an advance in their relationship, the producers unwilling to take for the continuation of this franchise.  
 
In this season, more battles, inferred slaughters, introductions to viscous demented characters, but always in the end, did not go out of bounds from the usual kind of endings in each story, still the same as the first season in this regard. 
 
ps. sometimes, less is more, and more doesn't always mean less. And more frequent than not, this statement does not make sense. (pft) 
 
burp!

    so this might be a short review but no idea but honestly ill get into it 
 
Story: you wont find a story with this just a special OVA with all the characters writing stuff for a marriage thing and also doing stuff like that nothing really going on here 
 
Art: art was the same as the main anime so yeah nothing bad 
 
Sound: its the same OP and ED so nothing knew but nothing bad about it either 
 
Character: honestly i will not say anything about this most of the main and side characters you've are in this OVA and are the same so yeah  
 
Enjoyment: like what someone in the popular review said i honestly enjoyed this more than the anime (in terms of comedy) because this pulled it off better and the main anime didn't but otherwise yeah 
 
Overall: ill say this you dont have to watch this because this doesnt follow the legit anime just a side off episode but this was better than the actual anime to me atleast

    If you are a fan of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru season 1, then watch this OVA for some light fanservice. It is non-canon and features many popular characters from the series.  
 
The point of this OVA was likely a response to fan mail post season 1. It also serves as a teaser for season two without spoiling any story points as its non-canon.  
 
Story - The service club must help Shizuka Hiratsuka with a wedding magazine request. This allows you to see all your favorite female characters and side characters dress up. The story doesn't matter since its non-canon but it does setup a harem-esque ending. For fans of this anime, most people should welcome this OVA as a way to satiate their appetites. Yet I was hoping that there would be more in this OVA than a throwaway episode.  
 
Characters - All the characters act just like they do in season 1. Part of the charm in this anime is that some characters are less superficial and more developed compared to other anime. Expect all the hijinks you would in this light fanservice OVA. Unlike the anime series, you will not find the philosophical monologues from the MC.  
 
The bottom line is that if you are a fan, you should watch this. The reason why I rated it average is because many other anime have done a lot more with OVAs than what we get here. The possibilities are endless. We could have seen more of other characters that get less screen time. The other factors are that it was used to promote/hype the second season. So I also see it was a marketing gimmick as well as a way to respond to fans of the show. Brain Base had an excellent opportunity to do more here but instead what we get is almost a throwaway OVA in retrospect.

    If you watched the series before the OVA, the characters are the same and just as entertaining. If you haven't watched the series this is definitely a fan service OVA than something that can be watched as an introduction to the series. 
 
Marriage is weird isn't it? You basically devote the rest of your life to one person and if it all goes okay you don't die alone. The OVA attempts to address marriage in a way we young'uns can understand. 
 
The story is nothing special. The service club is commissioned to fill the space of a magazine that will advertise the town as a hotspot for weddings and make marriage more appealing to younger people. To do this they send out a survey to their class and find that the overall idea of marriage among high school students is lacking. They attempt to gain a better understanding of marriage by asking Komachi because she takes care of Hikigaya. She issues a series of ""marriage challenges"" that all of the characters participate in. This includes cooking, trivia and wearing a bridal gown, all of which were fun to watch. 
 
The art and sound was standard to the series, and the dialogue made me laugh a lot even though it was pretty much the same as the series.  
 
What irked me was the sexist portrayal of marriage. The writers seemed to paint a picture of marriage as something where the majority of the work is done by women for the men and none of that should be questioned. The trivia section made this extremely evident because the questions posed were how to be the perfect housewife.  
While everyone (including Hikigaya) gave varied and valid answers, all of them were shot down and replaced with Komachi's ideal answer. What I got from it is that there is a specific way wives are supposed to treat their husbands and their family. In this way the writers have restricted what marriage really is and replaced it with a sexist ideal.  
Maybe I shouldn't take it so seriously, but in a series with strong female characters I expected more than this. 
 
Watch it because it's entertaining. However, be wary and treat your SO equally.

    It's been roughly a year since I finished the TV version and with the announcement of a second season I immediately craved more. And then it happened, I found out an OVA existed, which I just recently had the pleasure of watching! 
 
The story has nothing to do with the TV version, it's just a side story. The story wasn't anything special but the comedy is what carried the OVA, It's top notch, perhaps even surpassing the TV serie's comedy. Basicly Hiratsuka-Sensei (Their teacher) has to write about marriage and asks the Volunteer Servie club after help since she's hopeless when it comes to marriage, they agree, naturally. So they spend an entire day in the club room coming up with and later doing those hilarious ideas. There are a lot of funny and memorable moments throughout the OVA - Such as Hachi's obsession with Totsuka Saika (The trap) or the usual genius dialogues between Hachiman and Yukino. You know, the good 'ol stuff. 
 
there's not really much to complain about the characters, It's the usual gang - Hachi moping about how boring life is, cold-hearted Yukino with her facts, and the cute trap for the fan-service of course. So there's not really any character development present, just fan service! The art and sound? Almost identical to the TV version. they really didn't hold back on the production value considering it's only an OVA.  
 
So If you want a relief episode that surely will bring laughter and a big smile to your face, then I can guarantee that this won't dissapoint you.

    Be honest, if you watch this, you're watching for the tanks and possibly the cute girls. 
 
I initially avoided this show based on the title alone (preview collections weren't something I was aware of at the time), thinking ""Great, another shallow moe show that will probably use cardboard characters and crummy plot."" What I didn't expect when I watched one of my favorite YouTubers (""The Mighty Jingles"") do a commentary on selected scenes was a fantastic soundtrack and ridiculously hilarious humor. ""All right, let's give this a try."" 
 
Spoiler (sort of): Yeah, it's a shallow moe show with cardboard characters and a plot you'll largely not care much about. But it's funny! 
 
The good news is that the cliched and one-dimensional characters are primarily minor characters, and there's about as many girls in this series as in Negima. Asking for all of them to be well-rounded and dynamic is an exercise in futility, and the show goes out of its way to have fun with the cliches. The characters can start out annoying at first (in particular the M3 crew), but they can grow on you (and in another review I've written, it's better than listening to 5-year-old girls be loud because they can). In the end Karina (the Rabbit team's driver) is one of my favorite girls (especially after the Monty Python sketch parody), and I have a custom decal based on the Rabbit team logo. The central five characters are a bit of a moe cliche party themselves, but their friendship nicely buoys the production and conveys the central theme of the show. 
 
Yes, the plot is ridiculous. But that's the gag of the show, if you treat it like a long joke or a stand-up act, you'll find plenty of opportunities to laugh. If you get hung up on realism (as though that ever matters much in anime), you'll probably rip your hair out until you're bald. 
 
Even the tanks are funny. In real life, tanks don't drive around like race cars and have the potential to penetrate everything at point-blank range, nor are the crew compartments indestructible. But bowing to realism there would make a very different show, like Sora no Woto or Valkyria Chronicles. Aside from the first (exhibition) match, however, the tank tactics are surprisingly realistic-- Firing from higher ground is a double-edged sword, shooting into a tank's lower glacis armor is usually a great idea, etc. It seems that with the final episodes, the production staff realize that making the tank battle ridiculous as well is the trick, and we start to see tanks flipping over dramatically and a scrappy gang of smaller tanks defeat the heaviest tank in history. 
 
One of the gems in this production is easily the soundtrack. Many of the teams in the show are themed after actual nations' tank battalions in World War II, and the music adopts marches (or in the case of the Soviet Union, a folk song) used by those nations. I loved the playful arrangement of British Grenadiers and a surprisingly accurate rendition of Sousa's Field Artillery March (I know, he arranged, not composed it, it's a good arrangement). But the Senshado March (or as I like to call it, the Ooarai Girls' High School fight song) is catchy and memorable, and the main melody is used liberally in different tempos and instruments depending on the mood; it even changes to minor key when the going gets really tough, and when the team is learning new things, it's arranged like a practice etude for a band. I just love it when a composer has fun with a theme like that. Dream Riser by Choucho is all right, and it's even better coupled with the opening animation. Enter Enter Mission... well, I guess that's a staple of moe anime.

    As someone who is familiar with WW2 background this anime have a lot of historical reference. The story and the character is...okay. But the visual and the sound is really really good. The details for the tank, the equipment, the stereotypes of each school(country). The person who make this anime really knows their stuff. Like the marching song each school match their country, the uniform also match the real stuff.  
 
But as every fighting anime you have the usual plot armor and the speed for each tank...just ignore it or it will make your eyes bleed. 
 
Someone on Youtube did a video about all of the historical reference, I really recommend you watch it.

    I love Girls und Panzer, it is my favourite anime and one of my favourite shows that I have ever seen. The things that I love about it are quite simple, it has good art and sound design and a decent sports tournament story (if a little cliche).  
Undeniably the biggest factor that made me fall so in love with this show is just how much fun it is. It's a stupid show about girls in tanks fighting with said tanks, it has a stupid premise and the show just runs with it. It is clear to me that the people who worked on this show put passion and effort into this dumb show about tank fighting and that makes me love it even more. 
Aside from the fact that it is just pure dumb fun, it is for the most part, just an upbeat happy show. There are moments when it does get a bit serious, but that doesn't detract from the sense of upbeat happiness that the show is full to the brim with. 
Girls und Panzer also has, in my opinion, some of the best fight scenes that I have seen in animation. The way that the tanks move and interact with each-other is really well animated and aside from some stupid things like tank drifting, the shows fights do stay fairly realistic. 
All of this just kind of clashes together and creates magnificence.

    It’s not a complex story, unexpected plot-twists or character development which makes this show ingenious. No It’s something slightly different. Let me describe it. 
 
Well this might be long-track run but I want to make sure everybody understands why this show deserves 10/10 score. 
 
First of all I have a feeling that most of the people who gave this anime bad score, dropped it or marked is as ,,cancer“ simply aren’t the target audience. So before we move to describing what is the anime about it would be good idea to describe WHO IS THIS ANIME FOR.  
 
And the answer is pretty easy... WWII/MILITARY nerds. This show was simply made by WWII enthusiasts for WWII enthusiasts. Of course, if you can’t tell the difference between Sherman and Tiger (and after watching this you probably will be able to) you can still enjoy the show... But remember that those WWII neets will enjoy the show six times more... Why is it like this? 
 
Well as I said, there is one thing that makes this show glorious...  
R E F E R E N C E S. This show is full of WWII/ military references and ,,inside jokes“. Some of them are so obvious that you will get them even if you didn’t pay attention in history class... Some of them are so well hidden that only consecrated people will understand. And I personally believe that I also missed some. 
 
If you don’t want to know further reasons, then I can tell you this: It’s not for everyone but it does excellent  job for its target audience.Maybe that’s why it’s still alive even several years after its release and there is another sequel airing...  
 
One more thing before moving to describing the plot and stuff. Since this was my first anime, I can clearly confirm, that even if you are not into anime, you can still watch it, and maybe it will make you consider watching anime more and more (just like in my case, but as I heard from multiple people, I am not the only one who can call this ,,a gate to anime world“. Maybe it’s because it lacks typical ,,cringy or weird“ anime stuff like ,,white blank eyes“, running with hands behind and so on... I guess some hardcore otakus will refer this as a „con“, but I think this stuff is not suitable for this kind of anime anyways... 
 
Fine... With that said,  I can move on to describing the plot... Okay I will try to make this spoiler free but... Some minor spoilers might occur. 
 
So what Is this show about? 
 
The story takes place in a world where high school girls and women in general are allowed to participate in a sport (or techically martial art) called Sensha-do (the way of tank), in english translation often reffered as ,,Panzerfahren“ (tank driving). But I prefer calling it  ,,tankery“. Only women can participate in this, and people believe, that this will make them good wives (no really who wouldn’t like his wife to be able to drive those steel monsters?) 
 
It all takes place in a city called ,,Ooarai“, which is a real place btw, and many locations portrayed in anime could be found there actually.  The main protagonist of the series, Miho Nishizumi  just transfered to Ooarai girls‘ school. Even though she is from famous noble family that has a tradition in tankery, she came here because this school doesn‘t offer it. (name Nishizumi refers to WWII japanese tank ace 1st Lt. Kojiro Nishizumi , Voila! The first reference is here). However Ooarai school decided to start participating in tankery again. And Miho is forced to lead them. She also meets new friends (Yukari Akiyama, real WWII nerd who is basically alter ego of average GuP fan, Hana Isuzu who comes from noble family as well, yet her family is focused on ,,flower arranging“ instead of driving tanks, Saori Takebe who tries to get a boyfriend and tends to give love advice even though she has no experience, and Mako Reizei, inteligent but sleepy girl who has problems with attendance). The story follows Ooarai tankery team on its way to win 63rd National tournament, which is (as later discovered) nescessary to keep the school open. So much for the plot, now let’s take a look at those references more precisely: 
 
Schools: 
 
Each school in this anime represents one nation that participated in WWII or simply existed during that time and had some tanks. These schools are basically the most obvious references, not just school names but even insignias are made in a way everybody knows which country they represent. Also school uniforms are heavily inspired by actual army uniforms of those countries. And when I say heavily I mean heavily... 
 
So far We have following schools: 
 
Pravda - means ,,truth“ in russian, it‘s Soviet Union inspired school 
 
St. Gloriana - such British inspired much Posh school 
 
Saunders – Murica inspired school, fu*k yeah! 
 
Anzio - named after a town in Italy,( The Battle of Anzio, I’m sure you know  
what I’m talking about), yes this is an Italian inspired school 
 
Kuromorimine (Schwarzwaldspitze or Black Forest Peak) is Ze German inspired school (and one of the strongest  btw) 
 
Ooarai - this school doesn’t represent any specific nation, it’s mixed. All tanks are divided among ,,teams“ each team is called after an animal and operates one tank. So far we have Ankou team (Miho and her friends) Hippo team (History club members) Rabbit team (1st graders) Turtle team (student council) and few others... 
 
Jatkosota - Finnish themed school 
 
Selection University - uses american WWII, early post war tanks and british Centurion 
 
Chi ha tan – Japanese themed school is great example how authors made fun out of themselves, this school is famous for charging towards enemies (clear reference) but unlike japanese soldiers those girls use tank guns instead of bayonets. 
 
BC free – Baguette themed school 
 
Maginot (Named after famous Maginot line),another Baguette 
 
There  are some other schools that haven’t appeared in the show but we can see them in spin-off mangas 
 
Characters: 
 
Some characters (especially overall commanders) are representations of stereotypes of countries their school represents. Even Their names are sometimes made  from words or names those countries use. So we can see names like: 
 
Katyusha - overall commander of Pravda, can’t say even a word in russian  
 
Klara - Half-russian 
 
Darjeeling – Named after a certain type of tea, she is the Leader of St.  
 
Gloriana,very lady-like, always drinks tea and uses odd metaphores, (she is probably the most british character u can see in anime) 
 
Kay -  okay this is the commander of Saunders 
 
Erika - blond girl with blue eyes(typical arian maid), named after flower ,, heather“ (yes ,,Erika“ is ,,Heather“),you really thought, they sing about some girl in that famous march song? 
 
Mika – Finnish inspired character 
 
Anchovy - often refers herself as ,,Duce“ (duke) just like Mussolini did, she is the leader of Anzio 
 
Team Hippo (Ooarai crew that operates Stug III)  contains  ,,History club“ members, and each of them Is an expert on specific part of History. We have Erwin (kinda obvious), Caesar (Obvious as well) Saemonza (named after certain samurai warrior) and Oryou (some famous japanese woman) 
 
Songs and OSTs: 
 
Even though opening and ending themes are barely connected to WWII, authors decided to use famous march songs as a background music for action scenes.So you can hear re-recorded and pretty cool versions of Panzerlied, Erika, British Grenadies,Yuki no Shigun and other famous march/folk songs from 1940s. And here comes another big reference when girls from Pravda (Soviet themed school, if you forgot) sing ,,Katyusha“ while rolling forward in bunch of T-34s IS-2 and KV-2. This is probably one of the most memorable scenes. 
 
Another memorable references: 
 
While learning how to drive her tank Mako uses a book which looks just like Tigerfibel (German crew instruction manual made for panzer crews, those fiebels were less complicated than official manuals, they were illustrated kinda like comics and texts were made as ,,humorous“ poetry) 
 
Battle against Pravda is located in snowy area (Girls from History club said, that it reminds them of Stalingrad, what about you?) 
 
When Katyusha demands Ooarai's surrender,  Momo(Ooarai’s student council vice-president) responds by saying ""nuts"". This is a reference to Anthony McAuliffe who in the Battle of the Bulge was encircled and demanded to surrender. In response he sent a note to the Germans with the solitary word ""nuts"". 
 
The night before the Finals, the members of Rabbit team are seen watching ""Kelly's Heroes"". 
 
Now I will also talk a little about animation and physics. Tanks are amazingly detailed, you can really see that authors payed so much attention modelling them.  Please show me anime with better CGI tanks... Physics is however... Well even World of Tanks player would call it ,,arcade“ despite their detailed looks, tanks are moving incredibly fast, sometimes seems to have stronger armor then they should. And btw even though they use live ammo in the show, nobody gets hurt, when tank is „destroyed“, it simply raises white flag above and can’t participate in match anymore, however after small maintenance you can use it again in next match. But to be fair, some physical aspects are amazing (tracks physics is amazing for example, especially in Das Finale). 
 
I know I know, this took longer than expected but I hope, that you now understand why does this show deserve 10/10. It’s not for everyone but it does excellent job in terms of its spirit: A great WWII-themed show but with cute girls. 
 
Okay time to finish this. If you are into military or WWII (WWII especially) I don’t believe you haven’t watched it yet... If so, then wait no more, stop reading, close your web browser, LEGALLY OBTAIN  a copy of it and watch it... If you didn’t like history classes this might not be your cup of Darjeeling tea... But you can give it a try anyways... 
 
If you read it till here I am personally impressed and you have my respect. 
 
PS. More references are further described on gup.wikia

    Welcome to this way to late review, but since GuP was the first anime I've ever watched I wanted to write it anyway. Disclaimer: GuP is also one of my favourite animes so prepare yourself a review that might not be as nuanced as others. 
 
Story: 10/10 
 
The story in Girls und Panzer is quite straightforward although the true plotline that drives the characters is only revealed somewhat over halfway the entire anime. The story is not really why you would watch Girls und Panzer though, as the tankcombat is predominantly why most, including myself, watched the anime in the first place. This doesn't take away that Girls und Panzers has a well written script, it has quite a lot of historical references in it that really points to clever writing. Some ""easter eggs"" are not so easy to find though as I only spotted them in my second or third rewatch.  
 
Art: 10/10 
 
I really like the artstyle for Girls und Panzer. The tanks are all accurately displayed and the character models themselves are nicely drawn. I won't lie that I really like moe character designs. If you dislike the moe artstyle, GuP might not be for you. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
The tank sounds sound realistic and the voice overs are very nicely made. The soundtrack is awesome as it uses classical military pieces of a country to play together with the high schools which are based on the said countries. F.e. Pravda Girls High School, the USSR styled highschool, uses Katyusha as their soundtrack while St-Gloriana's Girls High School uses The British Grenadiers.  
 
Characters: 10/10 
 
This show has a lot of characters, A LOT. Oarai, the high school which is the main focus of the anime, has 32 members on it's own. Every single one of these characters has some kind backstory, although some not as much as others. All the other schools have at least 2-3 named characters too, all with their own personality and quirks.  
The Main characters are all very likeable and the MC of the MC's, Miho Nishizumi has a very interesting backstory.  
I've never felt any characters to be lacking something which results in this excellent score. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
I've not felt bored for one second while watching this anime, even after my 4th rewatch I still find it incredibly amusing. Watching it together with friends is also really fun if you can find a friend who is up for it at least! 
 
Overall: 10/10 
 
As I said at the start of this review, it was going to be quite un-nuanced. I really enjoy GuP and I would recommend it to everyone who likes Moe, Tanks and just wants to have a good time while watching an anime. Girls und Panzer is definitely a feel good anime!  
 
Thank you for reading and if I convinced you, Enjoy!

    This is my first review on this site so bare with me. 
 
At first glance the concept of ""Girl Ünd Panzer"" sounds as dumb, but also amazing, as the ""CARD GAMES!!! ONE MOTORCYCLES!!!"" (or Yu-Gi-oh! 5D's). I mean we are talking about young girls that ride  tanks! But the case is very different. This is an anime full of enjoyment that handles and exploits its unique plot at its best. 
 
First of all the art here is top-notch. The characters despite their really average style -  ""kawai"" school girls- are designed each one in a way that highlights their personalities. The battlefield planes and the movement of all the characters and the tanks is really smooth and give a good pace to the overall plot.   
 
Moreover the story is pretty interesting. The cliches are mostly absent even in the fighting scenes. No big speeches, no last minute saves or anything of that nature. The plot gave me each thing at the time unveiling the necessary part of the story; I ended up only wanting more in the end! 
 
The only thing I did not like was the opening, which was too generic, and the voice acting which was somewhat pretentious. 
 
All in all this is great anime. I recommend it even if you do not like lolies. It has comedy, suspense and of course it has tanks!

    Initially, I felt indifferent towards the Girls und Panzer. I gave it a fairly mediocre rating and moved on from it, almost forgetting it entirely. I had the interest of re-watching it with one of my friends after seeing their growing curiosity toward it, as well as my interest to remember why I rated something like this as low as I did. Needless to say, part of my opinion changed, but not all of it. Most of this won't be too unique from what NotDolphy has already summed up pretty well, but do read on if you desire. Though, it will contain spoilers. 
 
Approaching an anime like Girls und Panzer, your tendencies toward how you feel about the CGDCT genre starts to boil. However, you then forget about that after you start the anime and realize this is cute girls doing serious things. They never really suffer any 'serious' repercussions, despite how excellent their tanks are at acrobatics and sometimes even abruptly fly both far and fast from a blast, but we will talk about that more later. With this anime, you do indeed have the most notable breaking point, something that most anime of the CGDCT genre seem to overlook. That being ""what if the girls were doing things that were not cute"" and we come across something that, well hasn't made a huge dent on the genre, has certainly opened up a lot of eyes. And in some cases, even convinced former disinterested folk of the CGDCT genre to give it a closer look. 
 
It should come as no surprise that the majority of anime viewers like to look at the female characters the most. They generally have the most unique designs, are more fun to watch and a cast of all females avoids the infamous abuse humor you typically see involving the male characters doing anything that remotely upsets the female. Girls und Panzer is giving us the most raw designs established over the years that the majority of viewers have grown used to. You have a big cast of big-eyed, small-nosed, cute-looking females and not a single one will be a stranger to someone's affection because of this. None of the girls look unappealing in the slightest and are drawn on model very well. 
 
I can not stress enough how much this anime wants you to avoid, well, stress. Around the moment the anime starts (beyond the brief sequence spoiling some of the fourth episode), you are introduced to the main girl who, for literally a brief moment, has no friends at her school and is alone in her thoughts, worrying over an event of the past. Then, immediately, she is literally treated to a couple of best friends right off the bat. Oh, how I'm sure everyone would love for life to be that easy. But, I kid you not, they love her the moment before they met her. Despite the anime occasionally having a moments of ""conflict"" throughout their battles, this is the only real time you are treated to something more akin to a drama, though you could fail to take it seriously due to how little time you had to grow fond of the characters. Even re-watching this and remembering everyone, I still did not feel as much for this episode as it wanted me to. 
 
Speaking of pacing, this is where the heaviest negatives I have will begin. Despite how high of a re-score I gave it, these criticisms are going to sound harsh. The pacing in this anime is a real mess. The first episode tried to introduce you to Miho, give her best friends right off the bat to form a bond, throw the activity they are going to do, the serious backstory of Miho and her initial refusal to join the sport of tanks (Tankwondo, Tankery or whatever bias you formed first) at the demand of the student council. You know, all in twenty minutes. Now, I am not going to completely destroy this anime with the statement it could have done better with twenty-four episodes instead of twelve, given the budget really needed to prioritize the tank battles and, objectively, they could not do more than twelve. However, I will say they could have spaced the events of the first episode into a couple. And that thirteen episodes is commonplace as well, so they could have simply had a set of two episodes and them not involving tanks would have already saved plenty of budget. No matter who you are, longevity is something you need in order to bond with anyone. You can not automatically start feeling stressed over the tribulations of Miho when you take in how little time they gave you to love her. As such, the entirety of the first episode is the biggest weakness the anime has. 
 
Had I had the authority to decide the episode count, I would have said thirteen so that the first two episodes would involved Miho's introduction, a more natural way for her to meet Saori and Hana, them hearing about Miho's sadness more naturally, they all bond, they see the propag- I mean educational film about Tankwondo, Miho upright refuses Anzu, Saori and Hana comfort Miho and she has a revelation that performing Tankwondo can help overcome her PTSD and neglect from her family. I appreciated already how much Saori and Hana were with Miho, despite only knowing her for a day, but the whole ""serious"" vibe the final scene of the first episode gives you is butchered so heavily by being in, well, the first episode. This anime is not labeled as a drama at all, so something like this happening so soon and treated so intensively is confusing, especially when you consider how polite the student council treats Miho after this. I genuinely believe that one or two tank battles being shortened would have allowed so much more room for growing the cast properly. 
 
Pacing gets mildly better after the first episode, but as people say, the first impression tends to stay on you the strongest. You have most likely met a person where you screwed up the first time you met them and that changed their entire viewpoint on you. Girls und Panzer can feel this way due to how awfully paced the first episode is. And I'm certain there is a reason why many reviews avoid talking about it on here for that reason. It is established that this anime throws around plot points a lot, simply so they can get right into the tank battles and this is a big problem with an anime that established, the moment you started watching it, that it wanted to capitalize on the girls' relationships with each other as they grow closer in both friendship and teamwork. Exposition would have saved this anime a lot for me, perhaps enough where I would have nearly doubled my initial score for it. With that, the tank battles and enjoyable design, the anime would have for sure been around an eight or higher for its overall score. 
 
But, first episode and lack of exposition aside, you can thankfully be happy that this anime made sure the main activity was the most enjoyable. The tank battles are nicely animated, are usually a joy to watch and have comical interactions among the teams. As I said, character development suffered the most, but that means the extra time went somewhere else and that is precisely why you will get the best kick out of the tank battles more than anywhere else. This should be where your attention goes the most if you wish to seek the most enjoyment out of this anime. It is also a bit strange that this anime is not listed in the ""Comedy"" genre when considering how bizarre the tank antics get. I believe every viewer had at least one moment where they were laughing uncontrollably over the way this anime treats physics. And a lot of the girls usually act comical as well. Simply being funny doesn't automatically mean it should be in the entire genre, but this anime has a lot of comedy, so I believe it may have for sure been extremely close to being labeled as such. 
 
Really, I can not stress enough how positively the tank battles were received. They were so good that, eventually, the anime branched far beyond a series and made OVAs, a theatrical film and even has a series of movies planned, though you really have your heart out for die-hard fans of the anime who may not even get to finish it until around 2023-2027, depending on how delayed the final productions are if they want them to be spectacular. And it has a couple of video games that feel just like the anime you watched, a very rare case indeed for an anime video game, especially of the CGDCT genre. And to top it off, one of them is entirely in English when importing, so amazingly, it is not Japanese exclusive. The latter of the two games has amazing fan service, online battles and is a must buy for hardcore fans of the series. 
 
Girls und Panzer, for me, falls under a case where it poured so much passion into its goal that I can not hate it for neglecting character development. It is not the primary reason you watch the anime after all, but this could have been remedied by at least pacing the development they decided to give us better. If you are going to commit to something, do it properly or not at all. That aside, you will have a real treat with this series and, if you enjoy it, you have plenty more to look forward to over the years! And that is a very big statement for an anime in the CGDCT genre to last longer than a decade. Generally, they have twelve episodes and nothing more and are usually forgotten very quickly. I honestly can not stress enough how unique Girls und Panzer is in regard to how successful it became with the genre it has.  
 
That is the most amazing feat of the anime, as I have already made very clear by this point, and for any viewers who appose them, you owe it to yourself to watch the one that changed things up the most. As I said, if more of them changed that second part regarding the ""things"" they do, I imagine we could have more unique treasures in the anime world like Girls und Panzer. The cute things are enjoyable and stuff, and even this anime has a lot of those moments, but the primary activity usually being them interacting in school, their houses, etc. It grows old for even fans of them. I hope more creators are not afraid to step out of boundaries with it, especially with the success Girls und Panzer has achieved. 
 
So then, naturally, my best advice is to watch beyond the first episode. Don't be afraid of its inadequate start, for it grows into a much better anime if you allow it to.

    I feel like this show fills a hole that Upotte failed to fill  
 
that hole being moe girls doing military things, but aside from that it also is a very comfy anime to watch, if MAL had a comfy meter it would be a 10 on a scale of 1-10. 
watching the characters talk to each other just puts a smile on my face that not a lot of moe anime does. 
 
that smile isn't a because they do something cute rather its because your are watching them grow as characters they feel like characters evolving instead of just pieces of paper that retain the same characteristics throughout the show.

    When you combine moe CGDCT anime characters with the tension of a sports anime and contrast the moe with the raw power of military tanks the result may turn out to be something not quite what you'd expect. For me, this was the case with GuP. What seemed like a ridiculous idea turned into a fun experience. 
 
Story 5/10: 
 
GuP is pretty standard CGDCT through and through, however the setup for this by at first painting some characters in a bad light seemed contrived and meaningless, as their motivations being made clear from the start would have been far more logical, but that of course ruins the dramatic reveal. There's a lack in logic to a lot of what happens in GuP and if you're looking for logic in an anime about girls trying to blow other girls up in their WW2 tanks, you might be looking in the wrong place. The main protagonist is a veteran at the martial art of ""tankwando"" (the best wordplay in existence ever), and despite a distaste for it due to a troubled past at a previous school, decides to join her new found friends in their chosen elective after it gets reintroduced as part of the curriculum. The story revolves around their tank crews bonding and moving through a sort of tournament arc as they quickly learn to maneuver their machines in battle. The story moves along at a nearly breakneck pace but other than some minor qualms about the developments happening without much conflict, it makes for an entertaining watch. 
 
Art 6/10: 
 
The character designs range from uninspired to really likable and so do most of the personalities. The individual tank crews are all made unique based on an activity they all participate in (such as a club or sport) or a common interest or goal that drives them. This seems like an attempt to make the bloated cast feel less bloated, and at times it helps. Other times the sheer size of the cast was simply too much. There was some bad CG very early on that gave me a bad feeling about GuP, but this is rectified later on as the series continues and the art marginally improves. 
 
Sound 8/10: 
 
The sound design in GuP is pretty phenomenal. There's a lively OST filled with all the military horns and flutes you could imagine and the sound effects for the weapons of moe destruction are good enough. Each VA fit the character they were voicing well and never felt out of place. 
 
Character 6/10: 
 
I mentioned the attempt the series made to make the bloated cast seem less bloated by giving the characters in each tank crew a thing they all share. This doesn't work all the time and there were many characters that I couldn't care to remember the names of because of the short amount of time allotted to them. This is of course in favor of the main protagonist's tank crew, which each have their own quirks. However, even some of the main characters receive very little development or backstory and only serve to prop the main character up or act as comic relief. There's a message about how each of the cast has their own problems they're dealing with but we're only shown this for a maximum of three cast members in a short amount of time. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10: 
Overall 8/10: 
 
GuP isn't going to be a historically accurate, military sentiment driven experience. It's not going to be logically sound and the plot armor makes tank armor seem like a pointless metric to measure by. But GuP is a fun experience for the duration of its run time, and is enjoyable and left a lasting impression on me despite its flaws.

    I lost the stress with this anime. Definitely the creator of the story is a genius. when I started to watch it I though it was going to be one of those anime that I only watch for a minute, but the action combined with whole sub-realism made me enjoy each chapter. I love this anime basically for the occurrence. Dedicated and well educated high school girls working, fixing and using tanks is psychologically positive specially to motivate the STEM education in girls.  The only think it didn't like me was some scenes that were exaggerated even for such sub-realistic anime. But in general I consider this anime excellent!!!!.

    Girls und Panzer 
 
 
Guilty pleasures... everyone has one show, one song, one food, or whatever, that they are ashamed to admit to liking. You say you hate all that Taylor Swift crap, but then you catch yourself singing „We are never, ever, ever, ever, getting back together!“ in the shower (you know who you are). I am no exception to this rule, and I do love me some Taylor Swift, but that's not what I want to talk about. Instead, let's talk about Girls und Panzer!  
 
[Story: 7/10] In the world of Girls und Panzer, it is a common thing for girls and young women to learn the ways of „Panzerfahren“; Sensha-do as the anime calls it, which basically means the operation of tanks. Nishizumi Miho, quickly gets involved in tankery and her school takes part in the Sensha-do Championship, which basically means tank-battles. That is basically all there is to it. This is very much like a  Slice of Life, except with tanks. There are minor sub-plots regarding the individual characters, which I'll get back to, but the main focus of the show is the Championship and the struggle of our main heroine to lead her school to victory, despite all adversity. Nothing new, rather a known concept with a unique twist on it. The show is fairly minimal, but it does most of what it set out to do well. There is no heavy reliance on plot-convenience, most of it seems believable given the context of the show. A very nice story about overcoming adversity and challenges. I really liked that tankery was not just thrown in as a quirky little gimmick, but weaved into the world of the show rather elegantly. There are families, where it is unthinkable for a daughter not to practise Sensha-do, where this art has been practised for generations, some others who revile it as brutish and archaic. It is part of the society and culture. Now, there are some minor little nitpicks I do have. We are talking about full on tank-battles here, with live ammo. So, this not being a story about war, it may be a little hard to believe how eager these girls are to participate and how no one ever seems to die because of these battles, despite being in ostensibly mortal peril. And the characters constantly worry about each others well-being, so it's not like not dying is taken for granted. Also, there are some jabs at traditional gender-roles, tanks, of course, being traditionally driven by adult men, and the show does mention that a couple of times, but never really does more than that, which I found to be a little bit of a shame.  
 
[Characters: 5/10] The show introduces lots of different characters over the course of its runtime. We are first introduced to our heroine and her ever-increasing tank batallion and, as the show progresses, to the opponents, who all vaguely represest different nations. There is the main team, which is the one we are all rooting for, the British team, the American team, the Russian team and the German team. Unfortunately this is where the show falls flat a bit, because most of the characters have next to no development or even character traits. I don't know if this was the show trying to keep too many plates spinning simultaneously, with the enormous amount of side-characters, or if it was just half-hearted characterization. Either way, we are left with a troff full of secondary characters, who get one character trait, which often falls into sad clichés. And I mean, the British girls spending half their screentime drinking tea levels of cliché here, so you know it's bad. While things do get more rounded with our main cast, they too fall victim to overused tropes: There is the Tsundere one, the overly excited one, and so on... There are some sub-plots with some characters, usually revolving around their conflicting relationships with Sensha-do, but those too are mostly taken nowhere, or magically resolved. Where the show gets, maybe not a gold star, but a silver star, is in the relationship between the characters, which for the most part seems believable (if someone shallow), and I feel that this is where the focus was, as this is a show about friends overcoming challenges together. Plus the positive dynamic between the characters made me smile several times, and perhaps that's all you should expect from a show like this. 
 
[Art: 6/10] There is not much I can say about the visuals of Girls und Panzer, just because of how standard and unexceptional they are. From the character designs to the backgrounds, nothing screams out „awesomesauce“ and assaults the viewer with beauty. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however don't expect the best looking anime. Everything looks fine, nothing is terribly bad, but that's all one can say: It's fine... The animation of the tanks is done entirely in CG, and to the attentive viewer it will show, by what I mean, it could have been done better. I personally, as someone who does not know much about animation and has not watched every anime in existence, was not bothered by this too much. I could notice it, but it did not take me out of the experience. The tanks move alright, it seems authentic (mostly), and best of all, I admire the fidelity of the animators. The tanks, from what I could tell, are authentic representations of their real-life counterparts. Furthermore I found it interesting to research the tanks shown in Girls und Panzer and find out more about them.  
 
[Sound: 7/10] The sound of Girls und Panzer fares, in my opinion, better than the visuals. The music is cheerful and does its job of getting the viewer in the right mindset for the show. At the same time it is not too saccarine and cutesy. Most of the music are renditions of military marching songs, which have quite the positive effect, at least they did for me. There is even a rendition of a Russian folk-song from the 30s, when the time comes for our heroines to fight the Russian team, which I found lovely. The characters' voices are not... too annoying, but they do fall into the very high-pitched range sometimes. Also, the tanks sound at least sort of believable, although that is hard for me to verify, since I have never heard the sounds of an actual tank. As for the different versions, I typically do not watch dubbed anime, but I have heard that the dub is kinda shit, so maybe watch it subbed, which I think is always better anyways.  
 
[Personal Enjoyment: 8/10] Despite the flaws I pointed out during this review, despite the show being unexceptional when it comes to the artstyle, underwhelming with its individual character arcs I have to admit, that I really enjoyed watching this anime. Every episode had a pleasant effect for me, and I don't really know if that's a praise for the show, or an indictment of my personal taste. Girls und Panzer made me feel uplifted, cheerful, happy. And for this type of show, I think that's all that one should expect from this show. While I will probably not rewatch the show in the near future, I definetly am happy to have watched it.  
 
If you are looking to be enthralled by a gripping epic about war, and the absurdities of combat and the brutality of tank-battles, then what the fuck are you still doing here? It should be pretty clear by now that this is not what Girls und Panzer is about. But if you want a cute Moe anime to cheer you up, but also want something different from the unending flood of Moe out there than I can wholeheartedly reccomend you check this show out!  
  
[7/10]

    Don't like reading? Never fear. Video review here: https://youtu.be/tDNdmrXDld0 
 
 Have you ever had that one show you sit down to watch and you know, no matter how many check boxes it rattles off on your “should I watch this” checklist, you can never let any of your friends know you’ve watched it, because it’ll be critically terrible, but it’ll be a perfect guilty pleasure show for you, and then it actually turns out to be legitimately good, and now you can never tell anyone because they’re going to think the same negative things you thought about it? Well, Girls und Panzer is that show for me. 
 
Girls und Panzer at first glance appears to be some weird moe-blob show with some tanks thrown in to get the militaria geeks’ attention, but this show is actually a tournament sports anime, and if there’s one thing I love in my anime more than tanks, it’s a goddamn tournament. I think the original Dragonball is actually better paced than Z because of the many tournaments in the series, my favorite saga of Yu Yu Hakusho is the Dark Tournament saga, and I prefer the original Yugioh to GX because of . . .well. . . the tournaments. Hell I don’t even give a fuck about basketball, but you will sure as hell find me glued to my TV and filling out a bracket every year when March Madness kicks in. 
 
        As per usual for moe shows, Girls und Panzer focuses on one main with her core group of three to five friends, but the tournaments in which they compete are on a platoon level, which means that there are four other tanks, each with their own crew that tag along as well, but unfortunately the show never goes into any depth with most of them. That’s regrettable, because look at the girls behind the sticks of the StuG III. Look at them! 
 
        Who are they? Where did they come from? Why are they dressed like that? Why are they always quoting Caesar and other great generals? Not a single one of these questions is answered. Attack on Titan went into depth with their cast, despite how massive it was, and I can still rattle off over a dozen characters from that show right of the top of my head. With Girls und Panzer? Ehhhhh, not so much. Even the name of the main girl escapes me for a while. (It’s Miho, by the way) 
 
            So, in the tournament, the school ships pair off in, oh yeah school ships. . . . look at this shit. 
 
        That’s . . . that’s just fucking cool. I have nothing else to say about it other than we need a naval-based spin off series of this immediately. So yeah, these school ships pair off in these 5v5-ish battles with each school being populated by walking, talking stereotypes of the countries that they are supposed to represent. The British are fair, chivalrous, and way too preoccupied with not spilling their tea. The Americans are loud assholes who bend the rules to win. The Russians are cold blooded stoics that rely on home-field advantage. And the Germans believe zat zhe best tank is zhe tiger tank and zhe tiger tank alvays vins! 
 
        How do these tournament matches go? Well, they’re quite entertaining. They take a number of twists and turns and instead of going down the overused Deus Ex Machina route of total ass pulls, Miho and her gang of motley tankerettes win their battles via cunning strategy and deft tactical judgment. They simply outthink their opponents who see them as mere underdogs who have only gotten as far as they have due to a series of flukes. They even go so far as to use real tactics taken from WW2 historical accounts. I like that. Good on you, show. Treat your audience like adult- . . . well as much of an adult as I can be. I mean, I’m watching a show about highschoolers fighting in school sanctioned tank tournaments. 
 
            Also, they’re not using paintball rounds either. This is live ammo people! Hell, one group of girls gets hit, they’re tank is knocked out, and they have to put out a frikkin’ fire inside of it. What the hell? I don’t remember the football team at my school ever having to do something that batshit crazy. Speaking of what-the-fuckery, why are there no males at this school . . . or any of the schools? There’s males in the show, but they are only ever shown once or twice. The schools aren’t girls’ academies. The girls attending these schools always talk about meeting their boyfriends and shit, but where the hell are they? The tankery clubs are all female because the show makes a half assed attempt to explain that girls who practice tankery grow up to be fine and desirable women, but as far as I can see, all the girls who tell their family that they’re in the tankery club get treated like shit because of it. 
 
        As visuals go, the level of detail in this show is stunning. All the tanks are rendered in CG so 3D models have to be made for each tank type and they nail them all dead on right down to the fucking rivets. And trust me, I know they got the tanks right, I play World of Tanks, bruh. On top of all that the show has an immense offering of tank facts and trivia that’ll make WW2 geeks like me salivate at the very mention of the phrase, “Eighty-eight millimeter main gun.” 
 
        With sound, the opening and ending credits are okay, the Japanese voice cast is alright, but the English actresses just completely phone this one in. It’s really unfortunate because the animators and designers obviously put a lot of hard work and TLC into this project. The music however is on point. The jaunty little military pieces that play during the battles and as such offer a light hearted touch that fits the show perfectly. Unfortunately this is shot down immediately for me, because the best music piece of the whole show, Katyusha, is omitted. Originally sung by soviet soldiers in World War II and later famously performed by the Red Army Choir, it was covered by the Japanee voice cast who sang it, in fucking Russian, and the North American release apparently couldn’t secure the rights to Katyusha, so they replaced it with the fucking Tetris theme. 
 
        I’m willing to largely forgive this due to the sound effects they managed to put together for this. Every tank sounds a little bit different and unique in its own right. From the initial rev of the engine to its cruising speed, each group of tanks puts up its own chorus of diesel, oil, and steel. As a guy who grew up on racetracks in the southeast listening to hundreds of different engines rev and pitch, I can really appreciate the commitment that takes. 
 
       Overall, Girls und Panzer is a fantastic little show that has an even-handed mix of historically based trivia and narrative pacing that culminates into a show that I honestly think most people will enjoy, whether they be history buffs like me or just the passing anime fan looking for a short and sweet anime to grab their attention. My only complaint is that there hasn’t been that naval spin-off show yet. Oh wait. . .

    My initial response going into Girls und Panzer is actually really good. This show is lacking in a few places but makes up for it in others. This is a small, but well thought out series enticing to multiple genres of people. The best part about this series that draws you in is the Art and story. 
 
Story - 
The girls at Oarai High School practice Sensha-do, operating armored tanks! They take it seriously too, and since winning the national Sensha-do championship is such a huge deal at Oarai, they sometimes go to extreme ends in order to get the best students from Panzer class to sign up. - 
What can I say, very simple story that is very well thought out. You have these 5 main moe girls driving tanks. They use strategy and each have their own quality that brings them out. The fact they use actual tanks developed over the years is what sparks your interest. 
 
Art- 
The art is great, eye appealing, there really isn't much more to be said.  
 
Sound- 
The sound is fine as well, I usually just pass over the opening and ending, so i lowered the score a bit. Nothing appealing. Good Seiyuus. 
 
Character- 
I gave character the lowest score. I feel like every team around the main girls team is more appealing. They look so normal it hurts sometimes. The main girl isn't very appealing to me. If I had to pick anyone I would choose Mako as a main character. This however does not take from the experience and enjoyment of the anime. 
 
Enjoyment- 
What can I say... Tanks... Strategies... Lets shoot stuff.

    Pretext: I at first ignored this show when it was airing, with no intention of watching it. It seemed to me it would be targeted at military enthusiasts and moe lovers, even even though I like moe, I was afraid this would be using war and military (and by extension moegirls) in an indulgent way (like Strike Witches for example), rather than in a responsible way (C3-bu). Though, please understand that I had no idea about the actual plot, I've only seen some images at that point. Then later when I've heard bobduh mention a couple of times how GuP is a good sports anime and has nice tactical aspect to it, I decided to give it a shot. Well, and for the moe comedy of course.  
 
I'll start with the bad. GuP decides to completely ignore the problems of risk and injuries. And hence subsequent questioning of the sanity of the whole idea of tank battles as a sport gets ignored as well. And I'd be able to look the other way, taking it that it's simply a magical world in which the implied rule is that no harm can come to moegirls, and hence there's no need to question the safety of it all. Really, I'd be fine with it. It would result in a unique world, where details of the world aren't questioned not because the show demands it, but because it's not what the show is about. And there's our problem. Problem is that GuP breaks that consistency, and couple of times dares to use the risk of injury (and even inferred risk of death) as a plot point. Occasionally it's played for humor, like in cliffhanger between episodes 2 an 3, and hence forgivable. But later it's played dead serious as an important plot point, when it deals with the turning point event in our protagonist's past. Unforgivable offense by definition. However, luckily, even though, as expected, said thematic crops up again in the last arc, it isn't played out as a reason for serious drama or a plot turning event, so it can be at least somewhat overlooked.  
 
My second problem with it is that even though it plays off as a sports anime, rather than funky SoL or absurd, it completely ignores one of the fundamental aspects of sports, and that's team balance. You can't have 7v4 and still call it a sport, you simply can't, it's ridiculous. It defies the very idea, concept and spirit of sport. It betrays all the implications that come with the idea of sport. So playing it as straight sport at that point is just as bad as asking viewers to ignore an obvious plot hole. However, I do have to give it that it does go ahead and use that situation to put protagonists in the position of the underdog, as well as using it to have more killing blows, hence more action, and make them use seemingly desperate and creative tactics, which are fun. Tactics wise, it's silliness counters the seriousness that tactic execution implies. Only in last arc are tactics fun enough to completely overshadow that problem, they're ridiculously fun and fast paced to the point where any flaws can be disregarded due to rule of cool, rule of funny, etc...   
 
All that said, characters are fun and adorable, and there are ton of them. Concept is quite original. Comedy is funny, 3D animation is plentiful, amazing and blends outstandingly well into 2D style, soundtrack is great, as well as ED. This show really succeeds in being a adorable and silly tactical action packed comedy. In last arc, it especially shines in the department of tactical and fun.

    This show is about cute girls driving tanks for no good reason 
and so taking it seriously is a bad idea. 
 
The back-story is just a means to an end, namely putting Girls into Panzers on aircraft carrier schools fighting ridiculously dangerous battles for sport to improve their feminine qualities. I do not have to make this up. 
 
The tank 3D graphics are decent and do not detract from the anime qualities of the show in that little attempt is made to fake anime aesthetics here. 
A wise choice. 
 
One the whole there is little to complain about apart from the story: 
Prologue aside there are dramatic and unexplained variations in the performance of crews and tanks bordering to plotholes and the progression of the overarching plot also becomes exceedingly predictable with time.

    ""Girls und Panzer"" is one of those really fun anime that let's you know exactly what you're getting into right out the gate. Hell, the title alone tells you all you need to know, ""Girls and Tanks"". If that premise doesn't sound awesome to you, well than you have no sense of fun. Or you just a bit skeptical on how a show combining cute moe girls and WWII tanks, could ever work. 
 
Well, maybe I can help to pique your interest.

Story: 8 
 
The story of GuP centered around a form of tank practice combat known as ""sensha-do"", in order to teach young women how to prim and proper caretakers and wives. One of these young girls is Miho Nishizumi, who had previously quit sensha-do and moved to a new school in order to find a new hobby to replace it. However, for reasons out of her control, she is forced to join her schools newly re-established sensha-do club. Now with the help of some friends she'll meet, she must attempt to help the school win the annual sensha-do tournament against various other academies. 
 
Clearly, this is not your typical tournament series. The premise is what ultimately sells it here, and are what make the battles fun to watch. At the very start, the main characters are clumsily just trying to figure out how to even drive their tanks, but by the end they become masters of the craft. It's enjoyable to see what bigger and badder tanks our leads will have to fight against as the story unfolds 
 
Unfortunately, while the main arc gets plenty of focus, the sub arcs never really wrap up cleanly. They are presented, but never really resolved fully. It's one of those cases where you end up asking yourself, ""Well what was the point?"".

Art: 9 
 
The general art style of GuP is pretty standard among anime. It doesn't really deviate from what you've come to expect. The animation itself though is an entirely different beast though. 
 
Something you'll immediately take notice of when watching GuP is the extensive use of CG. Now before you say what I know you're thinking, which is ""Oh god no, not anime CG."", don't fret. The CG in GuP is incredibly well executed. It's used to give the battles a consistency that would be a massive undertaking for 2D animation, and it helps to give the tanks real weight to them. When you see a tank fire a shell, it really feels like they fired a large explosive round; the tanks rock and bounce as they move and fire in realistic ways you'd expect them too (until they decide to take some creative licence with physics, but it's anime, what did you expect). 
 
The CG doesn't overtake the 2D animation though. On the contrary, the two seemingly match together perfectly, in a way you'd never expect. The result is battles that are incredibly fun to watch, and are never jarring. 
 
-- 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The sound of this show is definitely an area where GuP really gets to shine. The music is fantastic, with all of it catchy and fun to listen to, and to really add a cherry on top, its all orchestral military pieces, flutes and all. It really gets you excited for the battles that lay ahead. 
 
Speaking of battles, these are great too. The sound effects used for tanks is pitch-perfect. When their treads roll, they sound heavy and lumbering, and each tank has a unique sound to it, and when they fire a shell, you feel just how loud it must be. 
 
As far as voice acting is concerned, it sounds great. All the Japanese VA's sound fantastic and really natural in their roles, and characters each have a distinctive voice to them. However, I must advise to stick to the Japanese. I've tried to listen to the English dub multiple times, and everytime I quit; it's just bad, with voice actors that are clearly amateurs and don't sound natural in their roles.

The characters are what will keep you coming back to this show time and time again (besides the tanks of course). All the characters are uniquely distinct from one-another, and you'll definitely remember who each is, especially the various academy leaders. 
 
However, you'll also come to grow attached to, surprisingly, the tanks themselves. Like the girls themselves, the tanks feel like characters on their own as well, and each fights in its own unique way, making them all distinct not only in design but also in battle. 
 
The one major downside on the character side of things is just how many their are. You'll get plenty of time to spend with our main girls, and even many of the academy leaders, but most of the side characters feel almost like minor's with little screen time devoted to many of them. Still, with what little screen time they do get will get you to remember them in one way or another.

Enjoyment: 10 
 
For me, this is one of the most fun and badass I've ever seen. The characters are fun, the animation and great to watch, the music and voice acting is fantastic, and of course the tank battles are absolutely incredibly to watch 
 
-- 
 
Overall: 9 
 
Girls und Panzer is a fun and enjoyable anime to watch. If not for some story issues, and if the side characters had been further expanded, this would be an easy 10 from me. However, these issues do not deter me from having a good time watching. 
 
If you're looking for a show with a unique premise and lives up to that premise, then I definitely recommend GuP.

    This show was one big surprise. I was just going to force myself to watch it, but it wasn't necessary. I really enjoyed every single detail in it. In an industry full of anime that doesn't go out from the typical and emetic ecchi/harem, where the ""plot"" is full of unnecessary fanservice (I love fanservice, but just in the way that Girls und Panzer offers it: A little here and there, but without being forced or even ridiculous), full of stereotyped and superficial characters, this show gives a great rest. 
 
Girls und Panzer has a a lot of very charismatic characters, who even if they have their troubles and differences between them, they know how to overcome them for their school's sake. Even the relationships that they have with their families, and their approval/disapproval towards the Senshado. 
 
It's not my intention to make spoilers, so I can't say much more about it. 
 
The CGI is awesome, the battles are intense and the characters are lovable. 
 
I gave it a 10, because IMO, a 9 is not enough for the level of awesomeness that I felt when watching to it. 
 
What are you waiting for? Just give it a try, you won't regret it! 
 
(This is my first non-spanish review EVER, since I'm argentinian and it's difficult for me to actually produce something in a different language. If the review has a couple of errors, let me know, it would help me a lot ^^)

    Okay finished the series, gotta say it at the very least picks up after episode 4. The show understands what it is, and sticks to its guns. For this at the very least I applaud it.  
 
The main draw of this anime lies in the tank combat, the girls are relatively uninteresting and everything else is rather dull in comparison. The fact that they use tanks as a sort of ""Martial Arts"" tournament in itself is.....well plain stupid. I am okay with anime being over the top and ridiculous but there's a certain line that shouldn't be crossed because it won't be taken seriously by anyone older than four years old. That is when you decide to call something ""Tank-fu"" or ""Gun-fu"" or whatever the crap you're deciding to call it.  
 
The story is lackluster and predictable, the art is solid, the sound is great and i appreciate the various military march songs, the characters are .... bare minimum, and the enjoyment is rather high.  
 
 It is a strategy simulator anime based around tank combat. If you like tanks, and you like chicks riding them.... full speed ahead.

    This anime was similar to Haifuri in some respects, however the plot want as good as it should have been and with the movie just repeated itself. The physics weren't very good but a lot of the time you could overlook this as it was enjoyable. Most of the anime was battling and combat scenes which meant that the characters were very difficult to bond to and this pulled down the anime. Overall, the best part of it was probably it's music with tracks like Katyusha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehhitnnB22k if you want to have a listen, there it is. I at least found this an enjoyable anime, but not the best anime i've watched and not one i will plan on re-watching, except for using the songs on youtube that is.

    To start with the 2D animation is very good, but what makes this is the 3D graphics, which are very good, and of course frequently used (mainly for the battle scenes).  What makes the action scenes exciting is that the tanks act like cars and are busy skidding and sliding all over the place 
 
The main problem is that it is a bit too sugary.  The girls are cute, there isn't really a fitting antagonist for the main protagonist, and you know that the girls will win, no matter what...  The ""enemies"" are certainly no strategists (and mostly cant aim) which makes the constant winning by the girls rather annoying - you just know how everything is going to end. 
 
However, the character development is nice even if more could have been made of it. 
 
It's certainly worth watching if you want something action-packed, but light and fluffy...

    The entire show is based around Girls driving tanks and attempts to shove as many tank battles into the show as possible, creating a very fast plot speed which quickly got in the way of the characters and their development and backgrounds. Events that happened for the characters were over in a blink of eye and didn't seem to affect them much even as it was happening. Furthermore characters quickly U-turned with their opinions and together made them seem shallow.  
 
However, it was equally obvious that the plot speed was designed to bring about as many tank battles throughout the series as it possibly could, which could be described as its saving grace. The battles were very well done with interesting camera angles and kept the show from going stale.  
 
While the characters did seem shallow there were still some attempts at comedy in the narration however these were far and few between and often the same gag over and over. Other supportive characters were created with stereotypes in mind and while it isn't very offensive, keep in mind that it will happen. Also there aren't any ecchi moments and few fan service moments to keep viewers interested in the characters.  
 
To conclude, I felt that it was an alright anime that might of been better with less tank battles, and more character and background development.

    And here it comes again! Another loli anime, this time, driving tanks! I know they are on Junior High, but it doesn't matter, as long as their appearances were enough to drag me all the way to the end! 
 
Girls und Panzer literally blows up any expectations and shows the route of a glorious way, consisting of friendship, team work and lots of commitment. Of course that a huge amount of armoured vehicles are introduced in the few 12 episodes aired on television. 
 
{STORY - 10/10} 
 
It all starts with this ""art of piloting tanks"". Sensha-do is a sport played only by girls and women, exploding their deepest desires for adrenaline and letting them feel what it looks like to pilot those wonderful machines. 
 
Our main group of protagonists, led by Miho Nishizumi, begin tracing the brighest way for Ooarai Academy. A previous accident may have destroyed all her will to get inside a tank again, but meeting some amazing friends would add both joy and excitement on every match she entered. 
 
A team able to get bigger and better, with more comrades and mobile weapons. A perfect and innovative plot, filled with intense and realistic battles, plus a heartwarming story of overcoming critics and despise... It's gorgeously unique and amazing! 
 
{ART - 10/10} 
 
When it comes to visual aspects, GuP uses everything on its range to be just the most authentic anime I've ever saw. Top-notch 3-dimensional renderization and animation direct all spotlights to the stars from these series: the tanks. At least 30 highly detailed models debuted in here, including remarkable pieces from german, russian, francese and japanese ground armies. Non-stop gunfire, combined to the smooth movimentation boost the conception we get from these beauties even more! 
 
But what it would be from those battles without authentic, distinct open enviroments, featuring all the unique aspects from their respective nations? England, Russia, Japan, US... Every academy choose the most suitable fields, based on both fighting style and tank nacionality. 
 
{SOUND - 10/10} 
 
""Close-to-life"" SFX is an undeniably important issue when looking for the best experience. Track movimentation, recharging, shooting explosion and penetration sequences, among many other actions require some attention to be as realistic as possible. Watching this show is like playing a latest generation videogame. Imersive effects, combined with the outstanding visuals, is all you need to literally feel inside those tanks. Way too impresive to put into words... 
 
{CHARACTER - 10/10} 
 
Such attention on tanks that I forgot the best part: girls... GuP takes advantage from this section, making use of a huge cast, 99% composed by female Junior High students. Our main protagonists are united through sensha-do and Miho Nishizumi commands the whole army of five tanks that represent Ooarai Academy. Each one featuring a different team with its own personalities, skills, styles and tactical abilities. 
 
Every new episode introduces more and more characters, until we reach the last one after hearing more than 30 different voices. What really impressed me was the fact that most of them are crucial to develop its whole plot. 
 
{ENJOYMENT - 10/10} 
 
Nothing less than perfect, I became amazed with such variety from both tanks and characters being presented on a 12-episode anime. This is all you need to start loving those engineering masterpieces and learn a bit about them! 
 
{OVERALL - 10/10} 
 
Receiving the highest grade possible proves the anime can't be compared to any other work ever made. Just like when you develop a videogame, producing a good adaptation from an even better original work is no easy task. Giving life to every combat saw in the manga and getting a final result from this level was enough to make my mind up. Definitely, the most visually beautiful anime I've ever saw and also one of the best shows I got the chance to know. Said that, ""panzer vor!"".

    The premise of ""Girls und Panzer"" was what lured me in to watch the anime in the first place. On paper it seems so ridiculous, that you kind of want to see how the studio responsible actually handles it. 
 
To sum it up quickly, Girls und Panzer is a lot of lighthearted fun, which actually manages to come to a suspenseful and entertaining, if a bit predictable, conclusion. If you're looking for an anime where you can switch your brain off, just laugh along with the cast and enjoy cool tank battles, then this is definitely going to be for you. 
 
The story of the anime is nothing to write home about. It is a classic case of ""Underdog rises to the top"". Unfortunately, I have to pick a bit on some parts of the story, because alongside the main plot, we are introduced to some side stories that revolve around a few of the main characters personal lives. These had some potential to make the viewer care a bit more for the characters, but instead they end up adding nothing more than pointless melodrama. They have no real effect on the story nor the characters and their development and instead end up feeling pointless and a little bit like filler content (Which is impressive in a 12-episode long anime). 
 
The art of the anime is one of its finer points. Production value isn't through the roof, nor does the show have a super-unique style, but it is packed with solid animation and excellent 3D segments. The tank combat is a joy to watch in every single episode. If you are a fan of tanks in general, I can guarantee that you will enjoy seeing many of the old classic vehicles animated into action (Even if some of the tricks and stunts they pull off are practically impossible). 
 
The soundtrack is another thing that helps drag Girls und Panzer up from the land of mediocre anime. It manages to incorporate catchy military marching tunes from across the world, such as ""Panzerlied"", ""The British Grenadiers"", ""The US Field Artillery March"" and the Russian-inspired ""Katyusha"". All of these are catchy and fitting of the show and their respective factions. 
 
The characters of Girls und Panzer are cute and that is about the extent of it. With the anime being as short as it is, it doesn't leave a lot of time to develop the cast, considering how many tank crews that are present. The main cast are of course given a bit more development time, but the only character really worth mentioning being something out of the ordinary is the tank-crazed Yukari Akiyama who has an absolutely infectious personality. 
 
At the end of the day, Girls und Panzer boils down to being an anime about ""Cute girls doing cute things""... In tanks. As such it is impossible for me to give it super high score. The only thing out of the ordinary here is the premise and at the end of the day, with only 12 episodes, the premise alone can't drag it all the way up. At the same time, Girls und Panzer is cute, entertaining and suspenseful when it wants to be, helping it stand out in the vast sea of ""Slice of Life, Moeblob, School Yard"" anime. 
 
And with that said, we come to the conclusion of this review, with Girls und Panzer receiving a very solid 7/10.

    Girls und Panzer scared me at first.  I was afraid it was going to be some hokey Strike Witch-isk anime.  Once I saw the art work, I had to see it.  They were using actual tanks, not just any tanks WWII tanks.  This was right up my ally.  The art was great.  The tanks looked great the backgrounds great, all in all a good job.  The music was good.  I enjoyed the use of the different countries' patriotic songs.  The characters seemed shallow at first, but seemed to grow in depth as the series progressed.  The story was actually unique, a rarity this day and age.  The battles were as believable as you could make them.  There were a few times I said that couldn't happen, but the best part of anime is the unreal mixed seamlessly into the real.  It was fun to watch and one I will watch over and over.

    So i saw that some people give this anime very bad reviews , i really dont care for them,  
 
i dont care because to me this is very very good one, although there is few things that i think should be better in overall i like the story, i like the settings and characters, and because i really enjoy it i give it 10 
 
One thing that should be better is sound, i believe that could be slightly improved but overall this is good anime and i highly recomend it, 
 
I hope that second season will be made as GuP deserve it, what do i expect to see in second season (if its made), probably to see more schools, maybe international ones that Oorai school need to face, GuP have potential and i hope its creators will see this and give us more,

    Girls und Panzer... an anime about secondary girls and World War II tanks... 
I saw this anime three times... but the first time I do not understand nothing of the plot.  It was because of the main character, Miho, that starts in a new school   and for some reason does not like the ""Maneuvers with tanks"" a kind of extracurricular assignature... Well she does like it until the end of the first episode without reason she decide to participate in this assignature in spite of she stay all the episode saying that she won't choose ""Maneuvers with tanks"" because she had bad memories about it... BUT IN THE END she choose it... 
At this moment the first time I saw the anime a question came to my mind ""What kind of hypocrite is Miho?""  
She was saying that she has bad memories about ""Maneuvers with tanks"" and then she choose  ""Maneuvers with tanks"". why? They never explain it in the anime, they will explain why she had bad memories about  ""Maneuvers with tanks""... But they won't explain WHY se change her opinion in the last moment... 
The next 11 episodes you will see a lot of battles with Tanks, yeah, but they'll have a problem with some characters that looks like total idiots... 
Miho has a big sister in another academy that has a lot of tanks... The problem with this is WHAT Miho do in this academy... 
 
 
 
SPOOOOOOOILER ALEEEERT 
We must suppose that Miho the only with common sense in this school because they were in the final and one of the tanks fell to a very deep river... Miho left the tank to save her comrades and they lost because they hit the Miho's tank... And then her mother say that she was a dishonor for her family...  
I mean. Is serious? Your daughter risk her life to save her comrades and you said that SHE IS A DISHONOR FOR YOUR FAMILY? 
 
 
At the end you can enjoy the show... but all of this points make that the plot has some weak points that you can not understand what's happening... I mean, for example: Miho when she finnally reach the battle against her sister... well her sister treat her like trash... Would be better if Miho let her comrades die inside the tank?  
Everyone in her situation would make the same CHOICE. What kind of monsters are her family? 
 
The sound... well, if you listen carefully you could heard some World War II songs but... It's not a big deal... I'm not a fan of war songs, they're placed correctly but for me it's all I can say about them... 
 
The Art... it's good, inclusive  the 3D. 
 
The Characters... As I said about Miho, my main problem with she is the one I mentioned...  
But it's curious that I only could remember her name, the rest of the characters except the Panzer Team are for have a big roster, these characters always make some stupid thing in a crucial moment because the Panzer Team is the star of the show who must destroy the enemies...  
 
Overall, it's a great show, but for me there're some problems that could be improve when they were planning the anime, like Miho choosing ""Maneuver with tanks"" making a contradiction with what she said minutes early in the first chapter...

    Okay so, be warned of spoilers.  
 
I liked this anime, truly I did. The anime is about a girl who used to practice this sport of tanks, but she quit suddenly when she failed to beat her sister during a competition. The reason she lost was because one of her teammates in the competition could have died, if she did not help them/her escape from the tank. Anyways, present time. The new village she just moved into, just decided to get into the whole 'Competition'. The reason why, is if they lose (Again I think.) their school has to close down. So the MC and her friends decide to go into the tank sport, and give it their all. Such as duking it out with girls from all over, America, Britain, Russia, to finally the MC's older sister.  
 
The only thing that was enjoyable about this anime, was the Anglerfish dance. Katyusha was also another reason why I watched this anime, the small, but great, loli, Russian girl. She was roughly the best girl from the entire anime, but other than that, I just got sidetracked from it a bit. 
 
Most of the beginning part of the anime, was the training. But at times they also would be searching for Panzers. The rest of the anime, is the MC and her pals working together to fight the other countries' girls. However, I faced a problem with the anime when first watching it. A Panzer, was inside of a submarine-like boat. Just how did it get in there? And how did they get it out? That was my major problem at first. 
 
I do believe they might have probably cut a hole through that part of the boat/submarine, and crowded everyone in the Panzer. But if you think about it, that's logically impossible. We're talking about steel like, that can only be melted of sorts. Unless they had a blow torch and did all that, it would be logically impossible to pull that Panzer out of that Submarine. My memory could be off, they probably did say how to get it out of there, or they probably showed the way they got it out. But seriously, they just say ""WELL WE FOUND ANOTHER PANZER"" and it was never mentioned of again. 
 
The anime style is also unique, but it's that part of where you notice (If you watched Strike Witches) that the anime itself was also made by the creators of Strike Witches. So this intrigued me, and I continued to watch it, and it was alright. 
 
The story could use a bit of work. Yes, I understand ""B-B-BUT THEIR SCHOOL FACING ULTIMATE EN-"" We already went through that before. Most anime could have done that before Girls Und Panzer. I get it. But I thought the end was a bit cheesy. 
 
Yes, the ending. We already have enough anime with the whole ""GOOD ENDING."" They could have done the whole ""NOPE, BAD ENDING, SCHOOL DED"" and then done something for a 'good' end at least. But oh well, most anime use the overused ""NOPE, GOOD END IS BEST."" 
 
The characters, sure they were understandable at times, but most of them weren't, because we only got like. One moment of their back story. Most of them however, we had no back story at all. An example, Katyusha. We had no back story from her at all, except from learning ""WELP, SHE GOT IN THE FINALS CLOSE ENOUGH TO MC'S SISTER, GOOD BEST CHARACTER."" Out of all the characters, Katyusha, the Britain girls, and some others were good. However, most of them. You had no clue what they were doing at all. And had no clue whether they were truly important to the plot or not. And the voices of the characters of the anime are good enough, I think they fit the role of the characters, which is why I think they suited the characters surprisingly well. 
 
Enjoyment now is quite hard. At times I would often get bored from watching the anime, but it was kind of killing you while waiting for the anime episode to end. Even when you were on the last episodes, you would be wondering ""OHGODWHO'SGONNAWIN?"" even when you would know the MC would win. It's not that shocking, but it was an alright anime. Some moments felt not needed, most moments felt needed as well. But that's the enjoyment you can get out of an anime, most likely. 
 
And finally, the sound. The sound actually sounds very good during this anime, the tanks moving, the ammo being shot from the tanks. It's all very good. It's not the best, that's for sure, but it's still good. At times you can hear them walking also, and I think that really counted for the time inside of the Submarine.  
 
Overall the things I reviewed. I enjoyed this anime anyways. I enjoyed some of the characters, mostly Katyusha. But I really do know that some of the things could have been worked on. But I give the anime an 8.1/10. It's not the best anime, but I would recommend it anyone to watch it at least.

    So.....do you want Azumanga Dioh crossed with World of Tanks? Then that's what you're going to get watching Girls und Panzer. The story following are main protagonist as they work together a band of misfits to take on the world of a all woman's sport known as Tankery! 
------Story. Ranked 7(Good) 
I only gave the Story a 7 because there's been a trend to the whole ""Drafted Main Protagonist into the Sport"" thing that's been done a number times over. My main point out to this would be the popular ""Sabagebu!"" anime about our young protagonist being ""Drafted"" into joining a club. Outside of that the two don't share anything else together. 
------Art&Sound. Ranked 8(Very Good) 
For an anime that puts highschool girls into fighting Tanks the art style is pretty unique. The art tells as well shows the gravity of each shot being shot, the damage is being fully shown, stuff is being ripped apart like it should normally if you was in a real tank fight. Does the stuff go overboard with how stuff happens? Sometimes. The Maus encounter was defeintly a bit over the top, I mean forget the fact you're facing a small army of tanks but now we're gonna drop you into some Armored Core-esc logic and put lots of small people against a massive tank! The sounding in the game is so believable that I honestly thought the fight was happening on screen. That's some pretty great work put into it.  
------Characters. Ranked 8(Very Good)  
Our main lead is somewhat of a deus ex when given the chance. A supposed ""family bound"" ace that gave up the life of being an ace like the other members of her family and wanted to be a normal girl. Its pretty saddening what happened so I wont spoil it for you but let's just say it will get you a bit. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but they're enjoyable to watch and when you get over that they really show they are willing to go all in when needed to. From the Student Council members to some of the other Tankery crews, its pretty enjoyable to watch them interact with the main protagonist, their crew and each other on the battlefield. 
------Enjoyment. Ranked 10(Outstanding) 
As someone that has played and enjoyed World of Tanks along with watching a slew of School-like anime Girls und Panzer is an amazing piece of anime. The show only had 12 episodes but I think the number of episodes was well warranted. From the fights to the development of the characters on and off the battlefield its just an amazing ride through and through. 
------Overall. Ranked 9(Great) 
If it wasn't for the story premise of the show I would of given it a 10 no questions asked. However while it did keep me from 10/10'ing the show I'd still rewatch it and recommend it. The show has promise for anyone wanting to watch a somewhat high paced fighting tank anime with anime highschoolers.

    【 The following is a review of : Girls & Panzer, Girls & Panzer: Kore ga Hontou no Anzio-sen Desu! (OVA), Girls und Panzer der Film, and Girls und Panzer das Finale 】 
 
Did you ever think you would see a show where adorable high school girls casually rode tanks through a small town, demolishing buildings like they’re flimsy cardboard replicas? Neither did I. Welcome to Girls und Panzer, taking place on a military base… on a battleship… that looks like a town, where girls are funded by the government to join the prestigious tank club and volley against each other in nationalistic teams to beat one another in a survival game of sorts. 
 
	• There are townspeople in this series that actually hope that their store or home will get demolished during a tank skirmish, so that the government will pay to renovate their old building. There are other ships with similar situations, that look like floating islands, representing different nations. This series is the epitome of every military otakus’ fantasy.   
 
	• I am personally not a military otaku myself, but I found this show to be one of the funnest anime series that I’ve ever watched. It’s ridiculous and does ridiculous things knowing that it can get away with it because it’s fiction, and because no one’s going to take a series seriously that has teenage girls battling in tanks.  
 
	• There is depth in the characters. The main girl, Miho, comes from an abusive, high maintenance military family that disowned her because she couldn’t battle in tanks due to psychological trauma. She developed PTSD from her comrades nearly drowning in their tank during a skirmish with dangerous weather conditions. Her older sister is hailed as the best tank commander, and so comparatively, Miho has to deal with real world problems and living in her sister’s shadow. 
	 
	• She’s decides to get in a tank again with her friends’ coercion, but there’s a lot of internal struggleーwith the memories of her past failure residing in her psyche. The other characters are really likable: there’s a girl who comes from a high-class family that believes in traditional Japanese women should partake in flower arranging, instead of firing paint shots from a tank. After all of the ridicule and fear of opening up to them, she stands up to her family’s rigid traditions and is able to make beautiful flower arrangements WHILE ALSO putting her all into her tank hobby. 
	 
	• There’s a girl who’s desperately trying to find a boyfriend, but ends up joining a tank club of all things. A military otaku who lives and breathes tanks and artillery guns. And, lastly, a cat-like girl who sleeps all of the time. Because, every moe show needs one of these.  
	 
	• There’s also a very diverse and interesting line of characters from the other ships that are entertaining to watch. I found the Russian team particularly interesting. Overall, if you have free time and a craving for something that is campy and amazing, then pick up or stream Girls und Panzer. 
	 
	•  I was amazed with how much I liked it, as a girl who has no interest in those sorts of things. It even made me consider collecting model tanks. This series is empowering, brave, and bold! I give the TV series for Girls und Panzer a 8/10, the OVA a 6/10, Girls und Panzer der Film a 6/10, and Girls und Panzer das Finale a 7/10.

    You would think that moe school girls and tanks wouldn't ever be in the same anime, but boy you'd be wrong. 
 
 
Girls & Panzer is an anime about just that. The story is about Miho, a school girl who has had a rough history with panzer and was basically exploited into joining her new school's panzer club. However overtime she realizes that it may have been one of the best things she could have done, despite her past. It's definitely an interesting concept of what it would be like if schools added a ""tank"" club to their list of extracurricular's. Albeit, a very costly club at that.  
 
Now many of the characters are skimmed over throughout the show. We get a lot of Miho's team, but not so much of anyone else. I really wish they would have dived a bit deeper into the other teams and their history before Miho's team had their encounters. But even so, the addition of interesting characters, as well as pretty damn good pacing, kinda smooths the show out. 
 
Overall I had a really fun time watching this. It's really...different from your average school-girl plot. While it could have definitely been longer, I feel that the pacing was good enough to suffice for the 12 episodes we got. Great characters, great animations, and an OP that get's stuck in your head. I definitely recommend you give this show a watch!

    Ah, the good cute Girls Und Panzer. (Warning, I haven't watched this anime for about a year so forgive me if I forget a name or something.) 
      This story takes place in a city on a giant ship. Amazing, eh? The exact year is not mentioned, but it's sometime after WW2 because they use tanks. LOTS of them. Of course, that's the whole point of the anime; sexy girls fighting each other in tanks.  
      The protagonist and also captain of the Anglerfish Team of Ooarai Girls High School, Miho Nishizumi, is seeking for victory in the tank championship because she was accused of last year's failure of her team.  
 
                    Characters: 
                    (Anglerfish) 
 
Miho Nishizumi - I thought she was the steriotypical normal anime character. Miho was friendly, bubbly, girly, and peppy. She never gave up on anyone and was determined like no others. 
 
Saori Takebe - Oh right, this girl. -.- She's the radio and machine gun operator of the Anglerfish. Saori was sterioptyped as the ""flirty"" chick. Although she comforted a couple of characters, I just despised her of her bubblyness. Enough said, I'm moving on. 
 
Hana Isuzu - Oh, right! This is the geeky girl I was a fan of. Hana was a chill, pretty, polite tank shooter/driver loved by the Panzer crowd. She was one of those rare girls that actually looks somewhat Asian. 
 
Yukari Akiyama - Here we go, another good character. I personally liked Yukari because she had that tomboyish, outgoing spunk which you don't normally get out of an anime girl. She was obsessed with tanks, too busy loving them for a social life. She's the gunner/loader positioner. 
 
Mako Reizei - She was mostly the dark chibi girl that stayed calm and didn't let anything get to her. She was mostly this cute, low blood-pressured emotionless robot. 
 
                           Art: 
Computer animation was used for the tanks, (which looked odd, but whatever) but mostly everything else was hand-drawn like most anime. *Shoves RWBY away* The character designs we're the most creative. but they didn't need to be because it's not an adventure/apocalypse anime.   
 
                         Music: 
Oh god once I finished the first episode, I got onto osu! as quickly as I could and searched for the opening as a beatmap. And luckily, it was there. (And luckily I stayed up for the rest of the night working on getting it perfected!) The opening is DreamRiser by ChouCho. (Right now I'm watching the opening and uncontrollably am screaming along the lyrics) The opening explains Girls Und Panzer very well and fluently. It squeezes in most of the characters in their own way of sass they express in the anime. 
 
Overall, Girls Und Panzer was a fast, fun anime. I'm really excited about the movie that will be released in December, 2017. There should be more light anime for tweens that aren't for 4 year-olds like Digemon or Sailor Moon, but they shouldn't be watching Code Geass or Fairy Tail either. Thanks for taking your time for reading this long review, and tell me how you thought.

    There are cute girls and badass tanks, 10/10! 
 
More seriously, this anime is something of a mixed bag. If you're looking for a strong story and complex characters, you're going to be disappointed. On the other, if you're mainly interested in the tank battles and an average story with cute girls, this show will be fantastic. The tanks are the main premise that this anime is built and falls on, and it does it remarkably well.  
 
In contrast to other works in the mecha musume genre (e.g ""Strike Witches,"" ""Upotte!!,"" etc.) this anime is mostly free from fanservice, which was much appreciated.  
 
Unfortunately, the anime falls flat on both story & characters. The story is a bland, generic sports plot line where a ragtag team of underdogs goes up against teams with much more experience and better equipment, and come out winning on sheer force of perseverance. Were it not for the tanks, this would likely be just another generic sports anime.  
 
Some of the background characters such as Erwin and Caesar (history nerds nicknamed after Erwin Rommel and Julius Caesar respectively) are memorable, and I honestly wish the anime had been centered around them. The main characters are easily forgettable, despite attempts to get us to sympathize and relate to them.  
 
But this anime is about tanks, so what about tanks, you might ask? The thing that saves this anime from being a generic sports anime is the tanks. They're bloody fantastic. They really did their jobs researching the various tanks and putting them into the anime. As a history nerd, I've got to appreciate the massive amount of detail they put into the various vehicles, from the American Sherman, to the German StuG, and even the Italian P40. It gets such a high rating in art from me primarily because of how much detail was put into the tanks. 
 
If you're a history nerd or someone interested in armored fighting vehicles, this anime is the one for you. But if you're primarily interested in plot and characters, this probably isn't going to do it for you.

    I will start by saying that I don't like moe anime, but tend to get sucked into all female shows with ridiculously specific genres that have moe elements like K-on, Saki, Strike Witches, Kan-Colle, etc etc.  But when my friend recommended this to me, I laughed.  I wasn't going to watch a show about moe high school girls driving tanks!  And then I proceeded to watch the anime, and then watched it again three more times.   
Girls und Panzer has more fanservice for the tanks than the for girls, which in turn makes it more interesting and enjoyable for those of us who don't get turned on by animated high schoolers.  It has an interesting blend of 3D and 2D animation that was utilized quite effectively, and the characters on screen make you laugh.  
The music is very patriotic, but overall fits into the military sport theme.  The animators did a great job using the tanks to create interesting camera angles that pan with the turret or go up and down to mimic the tank rolling over uneven surfaces.   
Again since I tend to watch a lot of shows that have big casts (like Kan-Colle) I think Girls und Panzer does an excellent job of introducing all the characters, and even make you care about them.  Sure, they may be stereotypical and can be found in any comedy anime, but I enjoyed the gradual introduction to the different teams.  Compare this to Kan-Colle, which is aimed directly at fans of the game and therefore doesn't provide much introduction to the different classes for viewers, and High School Fleet which after just watching this afternoon I'm struggling to remember the main characters name.  
Overall, if you have watched K-On or Saki or Strike Witches and had a good time, you might like a slightly more niche anime like Girls und Panzer.  No, it's not realistic, and yes it has cute high school girls driving tanks all mysteriously wearing skirts that never get blown in the breeze and expose panties, but in the end it was a good laugh.

    Writing a Review for Girls und Panzer 
========================= 
I will be writing a paragraph by paragraph review first scroll down for the broken down version (by category). 
 
A Slice-of-Life Action anime, more focused on the Action aspect rather than Slice-of-Life, I personally think I've enjoyed this anime way more than I should.  
 
The story-line may not be unique but it has been well executed, There's it's ups and downs and if you go into it neutral minded you will find yourself enjoying it, The art style is up to standard, the tanks battles are in 3D while the characters in 2D, The opening scene in the first episode shows this and honestly the tank view was very strange. (merge between 2D and 3D). 
 
The facts about the tanks are quite on point though you will find yourself pausing to actually catch the facts they are telling you, It would be better to google about it after watching the episode,  
 
This anime has recap episodes ( Episodes 5.5 and 10.5) 
Episode 5.5 recapping on the events of Episodes 1 through 5 while introducing you to our main cast and supporting cast. (plus their tanks) 
Episode 10.5 recapping the events of Episodes 6 through 10 while introducing you to any other character they have yet to introduce (plus their tanks) 
 
(In my personal opinion, If I was watching this as it came out, 1 week per episode kind of deal, I would be pissed off if the episode of the week is a recap :/ especially since they end the episode mid-battle.) 
 
The character's are a fun group with a wide range of personalities, Some being developed more than others but they're relate-able. 
 
I've personally enjoyed the season and looking forward to more . 
 
=========================================== 
Review divided into categories 
 
Story : 8/10 : I personally enjoyed the story it has some (very little) slice-of-life elements though if your looking for cute girls in action then you will definitely enjoy it,  
 
Art : 8/10 : No complaints about the art style, The art style meets the quality that allows the viewers to enjoy it without a problem, 2D Characters 3D Tank battles, I personally found the animation look out of place during the opening scene of episode 1, (If you read my other reviews, I rate 10/10 for *unique art styles that are well done). 
 
Sound : 10/10 : The sound is well done both in Voice Acting (Japanese Dub) and Sound effects. 
 
Character : 8/10 : A nice range of personalities exists between our main and supporting characters. Though characters feel a little underdeveloped. It's more about the tank battles anyway in this anime.  
 
Enjoyment : 9/10 : I personally enjoyed this anime more than I should, actually almost cried during one of the scenes, really enjoyed the battles lots of cool strats. 
  
*Unique Art Style - An art style that when seen by a viewer is easily recognizable between animes. (Same studio Different Anime, Viewer can tell its from the same studio) 
 
============================================= 
I hope you found my review useful 
Otherwise if you didn't please leave a comment as too why 
============================================= 
Minor Complaint (Does not lower the watch value of this anime) 
Sports in anime's, especially when it's extreme out of the norm sports.  
Are always unfair, The richer team always has an advantage and honestly in a real world situation I wouldn't find it interesting to watch a sport where the richer team always wins cause they had more tanks than the others.  
=============================================

    This show really didn't have the right be this good. 
 
I'm sure a lot of you guys reading this right now are a lot like I was when I first heard of this show, thinking things like: ""What is this, little girls piloting tanks? This has to be some stupid loli show, surely the person who recommended this to me was just trolling."" But I'm here to tell you that despite the shows questionable premise it's actually pretty good, not a masterpiece but a lot better than you would be lead to believe.  
 
Let's start with the story, which is pretty simple. In this world Tank battling is a sport called Tankery. Miho Nishizumi is part of the Nishizumi family, which runs a prestigious tankery school however due to an incident prior to the events of the show she no longer wants to participate in tankery and goes so far as to pick a school which doesn't have tankery as an elective. Everything works out well, she even makes some friends despite her shy personality. That is until the student council announces that they're bringing tankery back as an elective and that they're forcing Miho to participate due to the fact that for some reason they need to win the next tankery tournament and Miho is the only person in school with prior experience in the sport.  
 
Joining Miho are her friends Saori Takebe: The cliche girly girl who is friendly with everyone and who calls herself a ""love expert""...despite the fact that she doesn't a boyfriend herself. and Hana Isuzu: A girl with a calm demeanor who practices flower arranging. Before eventually being joined by Yukari Akiyama: A girl who is completely obsessed with tanks and hasn't exactly had much of a social life because of that. and my personal favorite Mako Reizei, who's entire character arc revolves around the fact that she's too tired to give a shit and is only participating in tankery because she'll fail school if she doesn't. 
 
There's also a pretty large cast of side characters but outside of the student council barely any of them get any real depth or development. However this doesn't stop the english dub from casting some pretty big name (for anime standards anyway) Voice actors to play some of them, the two biggest examples being Tiffany Grant of Evangelion fame and Monica Rial (Who is best known for being Mae Chang in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Index in a Certain Magical Index).  
 
Surprisingly enough the show actually focuses a lot more on the tank stuff than it does slice of life or fanservice (In fact there are only two scenes that could even qualify as fanservice and even then they're really tame.) elements. And the tank battles themselves are pretty damn impressive, the time when the tanks are CG while noticeable doesn't clash with the 2d animation at all and the maneuvers and tactics while unrealistic (I assume, I don't know much about tanks) especially as the series goes on are extremely fun to watch and make the battles thrilling. 
 
The only real complaints I have about the show is that as mentioned earlier barely any of the side characters get anything resembling depth or development, they're just there to pilot tanks and the fact that if you're listening to the english dub you're really going to get sick of one musical track in particular. 
 
Overall this show was a lot better than it really should've been considering the premise. I guess there's a reason that it got a movie.

    Sweet premise, the series really focuses on the tank models and mechanics and real combat strategy. The tanks are not a gimmick! 
On the other hand, there's almost zero character development and very little emotional involvement. 
Ton of CGI for all the tanks and city blocks, but it's well made and looks quite reasonable. Japanese voice acting is good even if it doesn't showcase a lot of emotion. 
 
This series (and the mange) was clearly made by people who love tanks. Check it if you're a fan of the subject matter or like combat strategy; If you want emotion and personal high stakes from the characters, this might not be it.

    Girls Und Panzer might have the strangest variety of genres of anime I've ever seen. I'd call it a CGDCT with action and sports, but right now that may seem like a very odd combination. 
 
GUP tells the story of Miho Nishizumi, a girl who, due to having come from a family with a history of excellence in the field, is forced to join her school's Tankery team or face expulsion. Tankery, if its name hadn't given it away, is the competition between two teams involving tanks (World War 2 era tanks, to be specific) to eliminate the other in a firefight. Obviously, since this isn't an actual war, the rounds used by the tanks simply immobilise, rather than obliterate. Nishizumi does find herself to be lucky, as despite having had no prior training or experience, does manage to be an excellent tank commander, leading her team to victory in many cases. While Nishizumi certainly takes centre-stage, her whole tank squad (consisting of a commander, driver, radio operator, gunner and loader) could arguably be the pentagonists of the show, as each of them sees about as much screentime as Nishizumi. Whilst these characters all have vibrant personalities, they are ultimately, not greatly interesting, and the viewer probably wouldn't be rooting for them if not for the fact they weren't the main characters, but they aren't exactly boring either. The characters who are much more interesting are the opponents of the main characters. These characters are all very much based upon stereotypes, such as the British team which is very refined and orderly (as is their battle formation), and will drink tea at any given opportunity and whose members are all named after tea, or the Russian team, which has little leadership beyond a small petulant child with similar leading abilities to Joseph Stalin (who is also as happy to send people to the gulag as he was), and uses the weather to their advantage. It is a shame that the main characters have little characterisation , especially since all the other schools have so little screentime after each episode wherein they have a battle, and despite a clear advantage, and initially doing much better, eventually coming to lose, and, while every episode plays like this and you can usually see it coming (it is a sports anime), it still manages to remain exciting throughout, and all of the episodes feel rather fulfilling. 
When I first watched GUP I thought it was just a bit decent. Another CGDCT but with a gimmick, this one being tanks, but that was because I myself at that time did not care much for tanks, the second World War, or military history in general, a position that I've now changed. Upon rewatching now being able to identify the tanks myself, as well as the omnipresent historical references throughout (and I do mean omnipresent, 5 minutes do not pass without a reference to the war, or a famous film depicting it. Even the birthdays of the characters are historical references.) it is a much more enjoyable experience, and while I wouldn't go so far as to say knowing extensive amounts about tanks is necessary to enjoying GuP, it's certainly going to make it more likely that you will. 
A sequel, named Girls Und Panzer Der Film was later released, and is essentially an extension of the episodic show, and of equal quality, which isn't a bad thing, but I do think that a 2 hour film seems to run far better than 25 minute episodes. A second film, titled GUP Das Finale has been released, and as of now, is currently on an unresolved cliffhanger, which while cleverly implemented via its subversion of both the characters' expectations as well as the viewer's, I think really was not a good spot to end a film wherein one has to wait several years for a sequel. Last-minute budgetary constraints are my guess. In any case, I eagerly anticipate Das Finale Part 2, even if it's not really a finale if they have to make a part two. 
Finally, a 6 episode OVA series, Yukari Akiyama's Tank Corner, is quite possibly the best OVA series I think I've come across. In it, the character Yukari, who is essentially a Rule 63 of every tank autist, enthusiastically details and compares many of the tanks in the show, and all in all it's very well researched and enjoyable, my only complaint being that she said the T-34 was one of the best tanks of the war, which evidently was the only research blunder that was made. 
 
Ultimately, GUP is a good anime. It gets everything it needs to right. The character interactions are enjoyable, the action is intense, and the music choice is strong and keeps the blood pumping, and there is something rather special about listening to the characters all sing patriotic WW2-era songs of their country. It's not revolutionary, but it's a lot of fun. If you dismiss it as 'just another moeblob SoL', you're going to miss out.

                     A IMP Review of: Girls und Panzer (Dubbed edition) 
(IMP stands for “In My Prospective”, meaning if someone attempts to correct the way i see the show i have no intention of reading any “corrections”) 
 
Story: Ladies and gentlemen do you like tanks? Do you like Girls? Do you like Girls going to school to learn all about the basics of tanks so they can fight other girls in tanks from other schools while they mostly all live on aircraft carriers? Well this show has all that stuff, plus a cheesy feel good storyline. Sense my favorite types of anime are Slice of Life, Fantasy, and Military I have high biases towards this show, but because the cheesy feel good ending but because of the base facts about tanks and tank warfare.  For the story I can’t give it anything to great because it’s been done before and it gets cheesy, so 6/10. Basic rundown, girl in tankery family fails, she goes to and school without tankery, school wants to do tankery, she agrees because  new friends tried to help her to be a part of tankery, they get ready for tankery TUUUUUUURNMENT ARC and use MC status to help them. Nothing to special, but because there’s no ACTUAL category for the other info in the show I’m going to make one. 
 
Realism: This is a special category for this show because the true realism lies in how the tanks are operated. Some may say that having tank warfare would lead to death so that’s not realistic but that’s where the anime/cartoon aspect of the show kicks in to help things work out so I’d say it’s not relevant to why I made this category. Throughout the show we are told how a tanks basic operation works, it requires usually a 4/5 person team to operate a tank. The gunner, the radioman, the driver, and the navigator. Depending on what tank you have it could require or fit more people or less people. How many shows do you know of that aren’t documentaries that would teach you something like that, ESPCIALLY anime shows?! Along with that the 3D tanks do a good job of showing how a realistic tank could and or would move throughout a battlefield or town. They also talk a small bit about using terrain to your advantage, tank maintenance, and a few other facts about certain tanks. Which I can’t give anything less than a 10/10 for, (this score won’t affect the story score but will affect the overall score). 
 
Characters: This category is rather tricky because we have a large variety of characters dude to how many drive each tank, however most of these characters get very little screen time and most of them just cheerily and chessily follow along with the MC regardless of how everything goes down. One has to take into account this show is part slice of life if not mostly slice of life so I’ll give the characters a 7/10 out of grace, I mean the main cast is kinda bland, we get some character development from some of them but it’s not enough to save them from their bland ways, hell the ship girls from Kantai collection had more personality. Because of some comedy between the characters, some characters being fun and the small amount of character development they were saved from a 6/10 but just barely, (the show in my opinion is more about the tank fights).  
 
Art: Let’s get elephant out of the room now; the 3D on the tanks isn’t something a lot of people don’t like. I personality  had no issue with it, on top of the fact that the 3D helped to show how the tanks actually move in reality, so even though I’m not always a fan of 3D either, 3D haters can go suck it here. The rest of the non 3D were in no way unappealing to the eyes but they also did nothing to unique, 7/10. 
 
Sound: In most of the reviews I’ve done thus far, sound has mostly been very low on my give a shit list, but those changes here! Not because of the opening or the ending songs, (I wasn’t a fan) be because of the background soundtrack. I loved here the light hearted and sometimes intense military-esk music in the background of this show, it added to the show as a whole either during the battle scenes or sometimes during the normal slice of life as well, 9/10. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10. Let me be frank, the only reason I really disliked the show was because it was EXTREMELY! Cheesy. I wish the “good guys win because we do” trope wasn’t so apparent throughout the show, if there were more challenges to overcome then just trying to find decommissioned tanks then the show would have been so much better. If you start out in a school that is new, you shouldn’t already be beating top schools, you should be working your way up the chain until you get to the final boss, and then possibly lose. Because it’s through failure that people learn. But I had no issues with the slice of life stuff, the tankery stuff was amazing, and the characters though bland were fun to watch so I enjoyed myself a lot, I just would prefer less cheese with my tank girls.  
 
Overall: I’m sure people would be confused as to why I’m gonna give this show a 9/10 with the issues it has, but ultimately it’s because of the aspects of the show being good, just honestly there needs to be more character development, less cheesiness and MORE TANK BATTLES! Then it would be a 10/10.  
 
Let me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I’m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own “anime records” so to speak, so if you see this and don’t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run.

    After the birth of Lucky Star and K-ON!, the moé genre has invaded every major genre to date. But, it has mostly focused on the slice-of-life shows. And even though it's still popular, it was only a matter of time until the anime community began to need something new. 
And in 2012, along came Studio Actas and made the anime adaptation of Girls und Panzer. And unfortunately, many people brushed it off as another cheesy moé show, even though the series is bloody amazing. 
 
STORY 
 
Girls und Panzer is about exactly what it sounds like. Girls piloting war tanks. 
Miho is a student who was a member of an elite tankery-based school. An incident in a championship forced her to leave and transfer to a different school with no ""Tankwondo"" program. However when the student council catches wind of her history, they force her to join the re-introduced program, to save their school from being shut down. 
As a setting it isn't that awesome, it's simple and effective to get the anime on a rolling start. 
The school then signs up to the championship, and the characters learn to pilot tanks. 
An intersting thing is that the towns and schools of opposing teams are located on giant ships! It is somewhat explained, but it still leaves a feeling of ""why the hell not?"" It isn't a problem, as it gives the show some strange variety. 
So we are shown how tanks are piloted, given accurate information about many historical tanks, and so on... 
Of course, it's the battles that make the show so gripping, with proper military tactics, absolutely ridiculous manouvres, and of course, the opposing teams. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
This is my favourite part of the show, as the giant cast of characters brings lots of humour in, and I'm not just talking about the opposition! 
We have the main group of friends, the Student Council, the disciplinary comittee, the disbanded volleyball club, the first year group, the motor club, the online gamers, and my personal favourite, the history nerds. They bring with them lots of references to historical battles, including the famous ""NUTS!!!"" reply from the American Gen. McAuliffe when given the option to surrender in Belgium, in 1945. Also, keep an eye out for Bon Jovi lyrics. 
Of course, this wouldn't be a Girls und Panzer review, if I didn't mention the opposing teams. I'm pretty sure that they are the main reason for this anime's popularity. Basically, if you want international stereotypes, look for Hetalia. If you want international stereotypes, that are so casual to the point that they're ridiculous, watch this show. Every highschool that competes in this show and in the original material, has a ""theme"" of a different country, from during the WWII before-and-after period. To summarise; 
We have the British: posh, proud and always fight with chivalry, tea and elegance. 
The Americans: loud, energetic and cheat to win. 
The Russians: violent, and use the winter weather to their advantage. Also, casual placement of the Soviet hammer and sickle on their tanks. (A bit deformed to prevent confusion, obviously.) 
We also have Black Forest, which are Japanese, but pilot German tanks which have the Iron Cross painted on, so I'm sure we all know who they represent. 
Finally, we have the Italians... Pasta. That's it. However, they have a full separate 35minute episode to themselves (which you need to find separately), and you kinda need to stop episode 7 just before the end to avoid any spoilers. (Stop after the bath scene if anyone asks.) Also, if you do watch this separate episode, DO NOT watch that part after the credits, at all costs. 
Anyway, what strikes me as seriously brave, is the inclusion of the Soviet symbols, the Iron Cross and the fact that the Italian team call their commander ""Il Duce"". (Google it if you don't know who that was) To be honest, the first time I watched this anime I was hoping that they wouldn't include the swastika. Either way, I'm still surprised how the creators didn't get into trouble as a result. 
 
SOUND & ANIMATION 
 
90% of the soundtrack consists of marches and other military band compositions. They fit the show to a tee, but unfortunately many of them sound identical, by using one musical idea in several tracks. It isn't a bad idea, it just didn't work that well. The opening and ending themes are completely average, and forgettable. 
The best parts of the soundtrack are the themes of each school team. Every team has one or two songs of their country theme. These are played when the specific team comes into the spotlight and begin to attack. 
""The British Grenadiers"" for the British, 
""Funiculi Funiculà"" for the Italians, 
""Blood on The Risers"" and ""Field Artillery March"" for the American team, 
""Kat'yusha"" and ""Polyushko Polye"" for the Russian team, 
""Panzerlied"" and ""Erika"" for the German team. 
I watched the subbed version only, I will eventually watch it all in English when the film gets a dub. I think the English version has been edited slightly, since the most memorable scene was cut out of the dub due to copyright issues. The sub also has more humour than usual, which is surprising. 
Special mention to Sumire Uesaka and Hisako Kanemoro who voiced Nonna and Katyusha who both sang the ever-so-popular old war song ""Katyusha"" in Russian, with almost-perfect pronounciation. 
One other thing I must mention in terms of sound are the actual sound effects, and in particular, the tank guns and explosions. I was glad to see that the creators didn't take the easy way out and have just one explosion sound for every tank... Also, very loud. 
The anime was made by Studio Actas. Not a studio I've heard of before. The character animation is fine, but the best animation in my opinion is seen in the amount of detail that's put into the tanks and their realistic (albeit sometimes very exaggerated) movements. The tanks are very accurately made, and lots of information is given on nearly every tank, which is a very nice touch. 
I'm not the biggest fan of 3D CGI in anime, as sometimes it feels out of place. In this anime though, it is perfect. The tank battles feel more action-packed and real with the three-dimensional movement. 
 
FINAL EVALUATION 
 
Girls und Panzer is one of those shows that you should watch, just for the hell of it. Does the anime make any sense? No. Does it matter? No. It is hilarious at times, especially due to the characters' dialogues mid-battle, like the Student Council members mocking each other for missing a shot, and also due to the obvious stereotypes. Definitely worth watching if you are in need of something fun. You will probably end up facepalming at the common ridiculousness the show has to offer, but at least it isn't bad... 
There are specials and OVAs that can be avoided, but I recommend watching everything, just to understand the world in which the anime is set in. There are 2 episodes through the course of the 12 episodes that basically do a recap, but they actually go into great detail concerning every single tank that was shown onscreen. Do not skip them, they are really interesting.  
I have also watched the movie, and a review will be coming soon... 
 
9/10

    When you get right down to it, this is actually a pretty conventional slice of life/sports anime. The characters are charming, their motivations are clearly established and the interactions between them are pleasantly satisfying. The comedy is gentle but amusing and well-timed. There's nothing that really pushes the boat out here. 
 
...with the exception of its total, straight-faced commitment to a fantastically, spectacularly bizarre premise, which has forever enshrined Girls und Panzer as a personal favourite of mine.  
 
It's a perfect example of everything I love about anime in general. Where the hell else are you going to see this? Someone sat down at a conference table somewhere and pitched a 'High school sports comedy/drama where the sport is painstakingly accurately depicted WWII tank battles', and then the guy on the other side of that table said yes!  
 
And then they made that show!

    (THIS REVIEW HAS A FEW SPOILERS) 
 
Over the years there have been various hybrid series putting cute girls into situations you wouldn’t normally see (Gakkougurashi! comes to mind). Some of these series manage to pull off the interesting contrast and others fall short. Now we have high school girls doing moe things while driving around in tanks. How does this fare as a series? Well, as you can see by my rating, not particularly well, in my opinion. Read on, and I'll tell you why.  
 
The story here is pretty simple. Various schools from around the area take part in the influential sport of ‘tankwondo,’ which involves two teams going at it in tank warfare to show which school can come out on top. Our main character, Nishizumi Miho, has just entered into a new school that doesn’t have this sport, but lo and behold, they decide to bring it back right as she arrives. The student council wants Miho to join due to her family’s excellent track record with strategic command in tank battles, but she doesn’t want anything to do with it any more. When she tries to turn them down with the support of her new friends, the student council president threatens to kick her out of school. She replies with, “Tank battles it is then, I didn’t want to join the tea ceremony club anyways!” (I paraphrased that last part) From here, it’s all about coming together with her new group of friends and winning the tankwondo championship for the school. So, what we have is an underdog story with the focus on friendship and teamwork. It’s a style that’s been done to death, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used well. While the aforementioned theme works well enough in this series, it’s hindered by various other things, a few major issues in particular.  
 
The first issue to discuss is the mood of the series. I know that this series is meant to be goofy and fun, with the contrast of young girls operating large war machines emphasizing this. However, they also try to insert serious moments and themes that don’t work well, such as the school closing down if their team can’t manage to win the championship. The problem here is they take forever to even mention it, which creates pointless drama. Then there’s the main antagonist group, the final team, which happens to have Miho’s older sister in it. They challenge each other, but Miho will have to win against the other schools first. What’s the problem here? There’s no tension whatsoever. You already KNOW they’ll make it to the finals, the battles themselves don’t have many gripping moments or cliffhangers and, because of the goofy mood, the “We have to win no matter what!” moments fall flat. Not to mention, there’s no tense background music to provide a more stressful atmosphere for these encounters. It keeps playing the same silly tunes, for the most part, so you’re left unsure of how you should feel. 
 
The other issue worth bringing up involves contradictions popping up. “We have our knowledge that the school will close if we don’t give it our all, so let’s do our best!” All right, then why are you getting out of your tank during a battle to thank someone for help, when you could easily and just as sincerely do it over the radio like the other teams? Why was a new team of girls seemingly not trained at all for an extremely important final battle? Why was the final battle between the sisters declared a solo match among themselves but, when the enemy team came to assist, the older sister didn’t call them off? Why are certain harsh and spiteful opponents automatically friendly after a loss? Why are they allowed to fight in town and destroy it? Even if they get reimbursed, why don’t the townspeople feel it’s an inconvenience? Why were two characters disowned from their families for ridiculous reasons involving tankwondo, then suddenly accepted again without any kind of development? Things like this just don’t make much sense to me.  
 
Now, how about some GOOD things? The main characters are pretty likable, even a few secondary ones. Their kind relationship with each other is nice to see, and they get developed enough to make you care about each of them. Despite having a huge cast, I don’t feel it detracts from anything here. The tank battles, while being mostly uninteresting, do have some good bits of strategy, particularly during the last fight. The overall art is nice to look at, and the tanks are also extremely well modeled and animated. Aside from the lackluster normal soundtrack, the opening and ending songs are catchy and nice to listen to.  
 
I really wanted to like this series; in fact I usually enjoy quirky stuff like this. Unfortunately, the problems detracted from my overall experience. You could make the argument that tank battles aren’t really my thing, and I’m not into sports very much in general. Yet I’m a huge fan of Prince of Tennis and Kuroko no Basket. In the end, it comes down to writing and presentation, and Girls und Panzer fell short in both areas for me.

    What can I say.... Over all the show was a 9. Because thats how I felt when I finished, It isn't bad at all. Even though it has all the moe stuff to it, It was actually kinda educational. 
 
It was also enjoyable watching the school battles. 
Though it must have been set in a harem world, since there is a lack of Male presences. So I was kinda suprised there wasn't a male in there somewhere, Like in Upotte. 
 
I loved some of the ideas and concepts of mobile nations or school nations. 
 
But after the first few introductory lessons, the rest was mainly just moe and battles. The battles were interesting, tactics were interesting. it ended on quite the cheesy note. but its was enjoyable, I probably enjoyed the battles more then the actual characters though. 
 
But still it was enjoyable. I would recommend watching in one sitting, since its short. and you can enjoy it more that way.

    I'll be honest, I normally pass over shows that look like they'll be solely about moe and ""cute girls doing cute things"" - it does little but serve to annoy me by saturating me with girly cuteness, and my ratings reflect that. Not even the promise of tanks (which, like every other red-blooded American male, I'd fall head over heels for) could get me to watch this. It took a surprise endorsement from another who had similar initial impressions as me (no name dropping, but you know who you are) to get me to watch this.  
 
 12 episodes later, I have to say I was fairly satisfied. Rather than being a platform to simply showcase different models of tanks surrounded by moe tank otaku-bait, I actually got an exciting series of tank battles, the kind that actually kept me on the edge of my seat. The slice-of-life and moe moments were easily the weakest parts of the show for me, but mercifully those became few and far between as the necessary character development of the first half was done. I still don't know why they thought it was necessary to have the girls freak out over a squirrel in the middle of a winter battle with the Russians, but I digress.  
 
 The battles were well-executed and fast-paced (as I said, I was actually leaning into the monitor to see what kind of trick they were going to pull off and inevitably win the match); I actually felt like they were using tactics to win matches, rather than special moves that come out of nowhere (coughEyeshield 21cough). It was accompanied by a very fitting soundtrack; there wasn't a huge variety, but all the tracks, especially the track Panzer Vor, had this very childlike and whimsical military march quality to it - I was fondly reminded of my Boy Scout days. The CG tanks were surprisingly well integrated into the animation, and only the hyper-smoothness of the lines and the lighting gave it away.  
 
 My only complaint is that the characters are very flat (not like that!) - I honestly do not remember the name of anyone besides Maho (who I personally found a little too weak for my taste, but whatever), and characters were constantly added but left unused for much. As a side-note, I had to calm myself down whenever I saw someone stick their head out of a tank without their damn helmet on.  
 
 All in all, I don't regret watching Girls und Panzer. I was pleasantly surprised by this series, and I proudly award it a 8 out of 10.  
 
 PANZER VOR!

    I honestly did not know what score to give to this anime. It was cute, fun, and had lots of action. The story got right to the point, stuck with the plot, and it was over in 12 episodes. I really enjoyed this anime, but at the same time, it wasn't the best I've seen by far. This is the perfect show to watch watch while looking for another anime to replace the amazing series you've just finished! And it's also the perfect show to watch when you really don't feel like doing anything at all, but need something to take up your time ;D 
 
Story - I'll give it a 7. It was a good story. Not too dramatic or complicated, and it was executed nicely. Once again, it's not the best show I've seen, but it was truly, and honestly ""good"". 
 
Art - I'll give it a 9. Everything was drawn well, just like most anime series out today. The tanks, the ship, the town, the school, the people....everything was drawn very, very well. IT was your typical anime art - nothing too special, but still really good. 
 
Sound - I'll give it a 9. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary about the sound. The effects were great, and the music was cool. It was your average anime. However, that is one thing that annoys me. Most voices of the female students were the same high pitched, whinny sounding voices that you hear in most ""cute girl cast"" anime. It's annoying, and I seriously want to give sound an 8 because of it, but all of the voices weren't like that, so it's fine. 
 
Character - I'll give this an 8. The characters are the same characters you see in many similar anime. You don't get to know them as well as you'd like, because the plot moves pretty quickly......however, many of the characters are so similar to others out there, that you don't feel like you're missing anything. 
 
Enjoyment - I don't know.....I'll go on and give it a 8. If I was looking for an anime to really impress me, I would so bump this score down to a 7, however. This show was cool. It was a nice snack while I'm searching for a better show to watch.  
 
Overall - I give this anime an 8. It was very good. I recommend it to those that just need something, anything to watch. I recommend it to those that like cute anime. I recommend this to those that like all girl casts, and/or girls doing things you'd think guys would do....this is more of a cute, ""girl power"" type anime than anything, so if that's what you're into, you'll love this show....otherwise, it will simply be just another good, or maybe even another really good show to you. 
 
:l    :)    ;D    :D    :)

    If I were to do a poll right now, I would be very certain that 65-80% who watched this show have played or have started playing World of Tanks/War Thunder. Am I right or am I right? Of course, I'm right. Right?  
 
 
[Story]: (7/10) 
Miho Nishozumi, who hates operating tanks gets drafted by the student council to join the ""tankery"" club. Along with her friends and the tank (Panzer IV) she's operating, she leads the crew to glory and victory. 
 
I've known this anime for quite a long time now. Way before your grandma was even alive. Ok, I'm going to stop with the jokes. I have known this show way before I started watching anime. I discovered the show while searching for WoT (World of Tanks) videos and that was about......2 years ago. I hated anime at that time but I don't want to get into that. Now that I have changed my opinions on anime and started watching more anime, I wanted to start GuP as soon as possible because my friends recommended it to me and they know I'm a huge tank nerd. There's a reason why I didn't watch the show when my friend recommended it to me and I'll state the reason on the Animations category. Let's get to the review shall we? 
 
I just want to get this out of the way first. If you're looking for a show with a ""2edgyforme"" plot or a great plot in general then you need to get out now because this is not the show for you. The plot is not the reason why I love the show. GuP shows that even if the show has a decent/mediocre story, it can still be enjoyed by the fans.  
 
Anyways, the show has a rather ridiculous but simple plot.  Miho gets recruited in a tankery club, she decides whether to join or not, and then they get on tank battles with other schools. Why is it ridiculous? For God's sake, their schools are in a giant-sized Aircraft Carrier and it also has a mini city. In other words, they live in an Aircraft Carrier. Want more examples? Tank Battles are a sport...being operated by high school girls... 
 
With that out of the way, I now want to focus on the Tank Battles which is the main purpose of the show. As a WW2 Tank nerd and a tank enthusiast, the battle scenes made me cringe....but in a good way. This shouldn't be a surprise but I enjoyed the tank battles way more than the slice-of-life scenes and who wouldn't? The tank battles are simply amazing and it's not just some dull boring tank battles. It's accompanied with Miho's clever strategies. Hearing her strategies and how she and her crew executes them adds suspense to the already-suspenseful Tank Battles.  
 
Another thing that I want to point out is how the Tank Battles really goes in GuP. What you have here is an underpowered and weak tank team (in this case, the Oorai Academy) going against a trained, experienced tank team that heavily outnumbers them. Not only that but the opponent's tanks are way stronger than Oorai Academy's tanks. So how do they deal with the situation and how do they defeat the opponents? Do they pull a deux-ex machina? Do they pull some kind of powers right out of their ass? No and no. It's all because of Miho's smart and clever strategies. She keeps calm-headed and she actually thinks how to deal with the situation going on around her. Seriously, this girl's got some great leadership. I can't give all the credit to Miho, however. If you're team has great leadership and all the team members work together to overcome the impossible situation then you have yourself an undefeatable team. So some of the credit goes to Miho's team member for executing her plans perfectly.  
 
Oh right, I forgot to explain why the tank battles made me cringe.....in a good way. I'm going to provide one example from one of the battle scenes and it's the scene where the Churchill and Matilda tanks chasing the Panzer IV. I can tell you right now that a Churchill and a Matilda CANNOT catch up to a Panzer IV. It's completely impossible. Why do you think both tanks have tough frontal and sides armor? They're not supposed to go that fast. Then again, they live in a mini city in an Aircraft Carrier so I shouldn't really complain about the tank's inaccuracy. If you don't know shit about tanks and how they work then it's easy for you to ignore the tank's inaccuracies. Another ridiculous battle scene is the final tank battle between a Panzer IV (H) and a Panzer VI Tiger. I think it's best for you guys to see it for yourself rather than reading it in my review on how it goes. There's more where that came from but I'll only provide two examples. 
 
I like what GuP did here... Every opponent the girl's school faces (The Ooarai High School Academy) are personifications of a real life nation that fought in WW2. These nations are Great Britain, Germany, Italy (cut from the show and was instead, shown in OVA), Russia and of course, the United States. So basically, it's like a group of mixed nations vs one nation. The girls in that said school also resembled said countries. For example, the Great Britain themed-high school has girls who are British, dressed in fashionable manner and drank tea, the American themed-high school has girls who are very enthusiastic and has a personality that shouts "" 'Murica Baby!!"" that you see in some American people this days or the Russian themed-high school has girls who are aggressive, charged into the battlefield and did not care if they die which actually happened in WW2. I love how they also sang the ""Katyusha"" Russian Folk Song in a heavy Japanese accent which made it comically bad. At least, they tried.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Art/Animation]: (9/10) 
Time to explain why I didn't watch the show until now. I have four words. Moe-styled character designs. When I first looked at the cover, I was put off by the character design..I thought this was going to be another moe-bait anime show with full of fanservice and tittie flashes. Thank god, that's not the case. Yes, there are fanservices in the show but there are only a few of them and like I said above...the main purpose of the show are the tank battles and the fanservice did not get in the way.  
 
GuP's tank battles and CGi tank designs are phenomenal. Firstly, the tank battles are smooth for the most part but you can spot some choppiness and the tank battles made it obvious that the show is running at 24 FPS (frames per sec). Secondly, The CGi tank designs are great. It's obvious that there are a lot of work put into designing the tanks. There are also attention to details and I'm glad they got the gun caliber of the tanks right so I can tell what guns they were using like the Sherman Firefly's 17 Pounder Gun, the IS-2's 120MM gun, or the KV-2's monster 152MM gun.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Sound]: (9.8/10) 
I have no words......for the show's soundtrack department. It's simply OUTSTANDING. I'm not talking about the OST's or the battle theme. Those were just bonuses to me. I'm talking about the tank engine sounds, the gun sounds and the tank track's sound. I really want to ask the director or the creators of the show if they actually recorded an actual real-life tank firing or if they recorded a real-life tank moving. It sounds so realistic and that 152MM gun sound on a KV-2 is a f*cking monster. That gun is scary as hell and I'm glad they gave the KV-2 a proper scary-ass gun sound. 
 
I was watching this show using my headphones with high-quality bass and it f*cking killed my ears because of how realistic and loud the gun fire sounds. It's worth it though and I would definitely sacrifice my ears again because I would be watching the movie with the same headphones. Now the OP and ED theme songs.  
 
The OP theme song is ""Dreamriser"" by Choucho and the ED theme song is ""Enter Enter MISSION"" by Miho Nishizumi, Saori Takebe, Hana Isuzu, Yukari Akiyama, and Mako Reizei. The OP theme song is actually the second reason why I started watching the show. It came up on my recommendations list, I listened to it, and I thought it was good. The ED theme song is pretty decent but not that great.  
 
I watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA. I am telling you right now that you do not want to watch the English Dub of the show. It is terrible and this is coming from a guy who watches most of his anime in English Dub. Hearing the Dub version of the show makes me want to grab my shoe laces and strangle myself until I pass out. Most of the characters sounded monotonic and it sounds like they didn't even try at all. Did they ever do retakes? What the hell were they thinking?! I wish FUNimation or Aniplex would have dubbed the series instead of that crappy Sentai Filmworks dubbing company. Luckily, I watched it again in subbed version.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Characters]: (7.5/10) 
Unfortunately, the characters aren't all that great but they're not bad either. I mean, I don't even know half of the cast's name. I only know the name of Miho's crew. In other words, I only know 5 of the main character's name. What does that tell you? That's right, the show focused way too much time on the main characters and didn't really focus too much on the supporting characters which were all part of the Oorai Academy. I would have wished they could have also gotten more screentime but considering that this is only 12 episodes, I don't blame them for only focusing on the main the characters.  
 
The character's personalities are plainly obvious like Yukari's ""nerdy"" personality, Mako's ""anti-social"" personality, Takebe's ""energetic"" personality, and last but not least Miho's ""something happened in her past so that's why she's acting like that"" personality. I've seen these kinds of personalities before...for like the millionth time. Whatever, I like Yukari's personality because I have the same personality as her. Like her, I'm also a tank nerd.    
 
The only character I saw who developed is Miho and her character development is pretty decent. In the first half of the show, she's a shy girl who had a terrible past and because of her past, she didn't want to join the tankery club. In the latter half of the series, we see her overcome that past. I think that's pretty much it.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[Enjoyment]: (10/10) 
The first 2 episodes were boring and I planned to drop the series. By the 3rd episode, the show finally got into the tank battles and I've been hooked ever since. I also marathoned the series and finished it in 2 days. The story and character may be simple and generic but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the show to fullest.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[VERDICT] 
""Girls und Panzer"" is a light-hearted anime packed with great tank-battles that shouldn't be taken seriously. If you just sit back and watch the show instead of criticizing every second of the show then the chances of you enjoying the show is very high. Also, don't get fooled by the cover because this anime is not about girls, girls, and girls. It's about girls, tanks, and tanks. If you're looking for an anime packed with tank-battle action then this is the anime for you.  
 
[OVERALL]: (8.8/10) 
 
 
Pros: 
+Decent Storyline 
+Great Visuals and Animation/Stunning CGi Tanks 
+Outstanding Soundtrack 
+Tank gun sounds, engine sounds, tank track sounds sounds almost realistic 
+Good Character Dynamics when they're all in a tank 
+Miho's smart and clever strategies 
+Tank Battles are phenomenal 
 
Cons: 
-Slice-of-life moments are somewhat boring 
-""The Battle of Anzio"" was cut and shown as OVA instead 
-Tank Battles may be great but does not last for over 2 episodes

Overall the story is alright but it seems like the main character will always win. It's sorta like one of those main character will overcome all odds type of story but still it was pretty good. 
 
The art is very bright and colorful and the landscape was very detailed. The tanks were accurately drawn.  
 
For the characters the one who mainly develops is the main character and her team. As for the other's they don't really focus in on them. 
 
I found this anime very enjoying with the music. It usually relates to the ""military feel"" as they play war songs and themes. The opening and the ending also fits. 
 
This anime was very enjoying and if you liked ""Upotte!"" you should like this.

    If you're into moe girls and military hardware, this anime is a must-watch! 
 
It holds up on its own, although you may not find it exceptional. The plot provides just enough character development to get you invested in the heroines, then switches to dynamic action sequences to produce tension. 
 
What makes this a true gem, however, is how realistically the tanks are portrayed (outside the odds of surviving a crippling hit if you're in one, that is). The tanks move like real tanks, not slow and ponderous like the stereotype but fast enough for Blitzkrieg. They shoot like real tanks, with hand-loaded shells, proper military sights, and rangefinding done with mental arithmetic involving the target's actual and apparent sizes. They even suffer from real-life limitations, such as engine malfunctions, bogging in rough/muddy terrain, track breakages, and lack of penetrating power affecting tactics on the fly. (Fuel and ammo limitations are also brought up, but never directly affect events.) The only unrealistic part would be the severe lack of efficiency in which the tanks are used, although the pilots can probably be excused for that, given that they're high schoolers. (Real-life tank battles are a lot less glamorous anyways, being mostly fought from a range of several hundred meters.) 
 
Of course, no anime is for everyone. If you don't find the combat scenes captivating, then you probably won't get much out the show as a whole. All developments outside of combat are aimed at making the combat more intense through personal investment in the characters; while this is a strong point for the show as a whole, it leaves the non-combat portions not substantial enough to be worthwhile on their own. Also, many of the background characters are one-dimensional, which some may find off-putting. (They form small groups of 3-6 which are *very* distinct from each other, each being the crew for a separate tank, though there's less variety among the members of each crew.) 
 
All in all, I'd give it an 8/10 - since it's kind of polarized between 10 and 6. If you've got any interest in military history and/or hardware (and moe, but come on... you're on an anime website) then you'll almost certainly enjoy this. If you have a friend who does, watch it with them and you may find it more interesting than you thought. Otherwise, it's still worth giving a shot, though it'll be hit-or-miss: there are much worse shows you could have wasted your time on. 
 
Panzer vor!

    Girls und Panzer 
 
Cute girls doing cute things , with tanks ! 
But seriously , I usually hate entries in the QGDQT ‘’genre’’ so when I looked this anime up I was almost sure that the tank thing was just mindless pandering so they can sell more blue-rays. 
How wrong I was. 
The show may not be a masterpiece , but it’s an enjoyable and fun ride though a genuinely interesting fictional universe. 
The characters are fun, decently written and are of the k-on variety , nothing wrong with that inherently. 
What really caught me off guard is how serious the creators were with their tank idea. 
Every tank is detailed perfectly and they did proper research involving what those tanks were like. 
The animation of the combat scenes is also stellar, although slightly repetitive sometimes. 
The point is , this is not simply a product but a passion project. 
They actually cared  about their show and the quality put into it. 
In the end it’s a pretty great gem in between the ‘’moe moe loli’’  shitstorm that QGDQT usually is.

    There is some fun to be had here. Girls und Panzer finds for itself an interesting niche in which to occupy. A colorful cast of main and supporting characters, more than enough action to satisfy, and quirky moments makes this show a standout.  
While there are some discrepancies in the tank information zone, I doubt anyone who isn't a straight otaku or did some research would notice or even care about. 
 
Music is OK with a massive two thumbs up for a random period piece in episode 8 that had me giggling like a school girl. 
 
Not much in terms of story. The draw here is the characters and the tanks themselves. The overarching story serves as a guide for development. 
 
If I had to nitpick something, it would be the length of the series. This series deserves 24 episodes. Here's hoping they give it another 12 episodes. 
 
A very fun and most likely memorable 7(.9).

    Hmm...moe...tanks? Wait, what? Such a thing actually exists? Yes. Yes, it actually does! Although, actually referring to the girls being moe and the tanks just being used, it still makes up for quite the combination! 
 
Story (8/10) 
 
To most this will be brushed off as your generic ""high-school sports"" anime with something bad happening to the school/club if things end up the wrong (read: bad) way. And even though it could be considered generic, it's still likable and I personally liked it.  
 
The sport however, is a unique one. Rather than the regular sports we know of nowadays, this one involves the use of tanks. And no worries, safety is assured! Well...90% of course. It's still a sport! 
 
The teams fight against each others with tank teams and the rules are simple: Take down the Flagtank and it's over. It's as simple as it can get. However, strategy, as with almost eveything, is the key to success. And the way it's done is very close, if not actually accurate, to actual military warfare. 
 
Two recap episodes are thrown in between, giving the viewer accurate and detailed information about what is actually involved and what is actually happening in our little world and who or what everyone likes/does. Will elaborate more on this part in the character part. 
 
Art (10/10) 
 
The animation is enjoyable and doesn't have (as far as I could detect) flaws. What made me give the show a high score on art is it's splendid CG (Computer Graphics for those who are unfamiliar with the term), especially with the tanks. Whilst to some it may not seem that spectacular, it's still pretty amazing.  
 
What also intrigues me is the fact that, the actual animation (the characters) aren't mixed up into the CG as well. They might not pop up as much in the battles (as you'll mostly see only 1 person standing out of the tank), rather than doing the characters in 3D, they are blended/mixed superbly with the 3D. This makes their animation not ""too awkward"" for some people and still enjoyable to those who can be a little bit nit-picky on the details. 
 
Sound (10/10) 
 
As tastes differ, I personally liked the OP and ED mainly because it's catchy and fits the ""moe"" theme of the anime. The anime as whole however, has well-fitting BGM (to those unfamiliar with the term: BackGroundMusic). Since the anime is conneted with tank warfare, it contains tons of ""army-ish"" background music. This gives you (at least, it did to me) a feeling of true military involvement.  
 
And that's not actually it. Even the respective nations receive their respective themes! The English have an elegant and noble sound, while the Americans have an active and cheerful (military) ""parade-ish"" play. The Germans have a respectable, ""strict"" soundtrack that slightly resembles them. And the Russians, they have their usual, quick-paced music. Do note that the German one is primarily focused on it's strictness and cleanness and not because the people are from Germany! The execution of giving the show a ""military taste"" sound is what makes them score high on my list. 
 
However, as a side-note in the sound department: Becareful with headphones/ear plugs. They have done an overwhelming (maybe a little bit too good) job with gun fires. This may result in possible, very loud explosions/cannon fires which could possibly harm your ears (and possible enjoyment) if your volume is on the high side. This did not make me lower a point in sound as it has only such an effect if your volume is high enough to make the sound overwhelm everything. 
 
Characters (9/10) 
 
The characters each and all have their own uniqueness (or quirks). The MC is quite the shy-type but can be very confident at times. She is accompanied by a delicate (who wanted to add some punch to her life) lady, a love/boys obsessed girl, a tank-obsessed loner and the ""I hate early mornings"" yet very smart fellow teammate! 
 
They each have their own problems. And while this is a generic something to happen when a group of people have to overcome something in an anime, it gives the viewer good enough information to understand why everyone is the way they are. 
 
Of course, there are also the other groups since it's not just one tank per school: The Students Council, The history lovers, the 1st year class and many more. Though they don't gain as much development as the main part of the whole team, the recap episodes include information of each of them. This makes sure that we, as a viewer, won't be left with too many things to think about. 
 
While I won't go in too much details regarding the enemies, they each resemble quite the ""stereotype"" of each of their respective countries. Again, do note that the German ""stereotype"" isn't because they are from Germany but rather the strictness and cleanness theme/characteristics from the Germans. 
 
Personally, I'm very fond of the interactions between the characters as well as the chemistry with all of them. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) 
 
As a person without expectation, I personally enjoyed this anime a lot. Considering the fact that it uses tank warfare as a sport made it, at least to me, unique compared to other sports oriented anime. The involvement of the tanks (especially the information about each tank in the recap episodes) made me enjoy military part more than I actually would have if I didn't recieve the knowledge about them and if the anime didn't casted actual importance on them. It actually gives the viewer a better understanding on why this anime is based on tanks as well as general information about tanks as a whole. 
 
If you like moe stuff with quite some action, this anime could possibly fill you with enjoyment and I'll encourage you to pick this up and hope you'll enjoy it too!

    I'll keep this as short as I can. I thought this anime would be a stream of memes like Konosuba and not much more. Cute girls driving tanks can't really be a story can it?  
Well I was wrong. The story is simple and easy to follow but it didn't feel underdone or ignored. It simply followed a common (but not unsuccessful) setup. No big wins for originality at its core but I was happy with it.  
 
The characters were fun and many were very relate-able.  
 
Lastly, despite this being a world where high school girls drive tanks around, it felt really natural and I didn't feel like I was being thrown into this kind-of sci-fi environment without explanation. It's just a place where Tankery is a sport and people love the heck out of it. 
 
10/10 will always recommend.

    ""Man, watching that anime about tanks was so pure!"" - words I never thought I would utter. 
 
I initially picked this up from hearing about it here and there and came in with zero expectation or knowledge, and at that point hadn't really watched anything similar. What I was greeted with was a very easy-to-watch and casual anime which I enjoyed start to finish. It's by no means my favourite, sure, but I'm definitely glad I picked it up. 
 
The characters and settings here are all delightful and for the most part uplifting. Despite there being moderate peril in places, nothing at all really sinks you into sadness, which is one of the show's strengths. 
 
Even now, I think Girls Und Panzer is one of the better drawn animes I have watched, even years on. The 3D parts were even alright (or at least, overshadowed by how bad some other shows are at it), which was good to see. The environments and characters are both visually pleasing, and I'm a big fan of the artstyle the show goes with. 
 
The show has an alright, but by no means revolutionary, plot. It had a good narrative throughout, and nothing seemed to be all that terse about it. I didn't really feel that much in the way of tension at any point just because some of the plot felt a little predictable, but I'm not so sure that plot-twists are one of the reasons people would really pick up this show. 
 
I do have to highlight the military-esque brass soundtrack that pops up throughout, it was a nice touch! I definitely enjoyed it and it helped make the anime so easy to watch. 
 
Overall, a nice, soothing anime about war machines. Oxymoronic? Maybe, but it's something that works a lot better than one my expect. Finally proof that tanks can be cute.

    I first watched it for the tanks when it came out but over the years I have revisited and rewatched it multiple times (3rd time now). In general, it's a pretty good and unique take on the military slice of life genre (similar to High School Fleet, Kantai Collection or Upotte for example), but instead of ships or guns it has tanks. 
 
The first few episodes are slow to warm up and don't provide much in the way of character development; that seems to happen as the series progresses on, with half of some episodes being dedicated to exploring certain characters and their backgrounds. In saying this, however, the supporting characters (leaders of the other schools in particular) are pretty much just shallow stereotypes of their representative schools; the rowdy American, the eloquent Briton, and so on. There is really not much expanded on them at all other than their presentation. The sequel to the series (Der Film) expands more on the backstories of Miho and Maho, though even that does it badly in how Jatkosota (a Finnish themed team) is introduced with almost no explanation whatsoever.  
 
Obviously ""Girls und Panzer"" has two parts to it as referenced in the title: The girls and the tanks, and without the tanks it would be a pretty generic slice of life show. The design and depiction of the tanks themselves were very good and the interiors in particular were accurately designed and animated. I'd say everything is perfect about them except for the depiction of physics (such as the tanks famously ""drifting"" and racing through the streets), though because it's an anime it's something that can be looked over. The battles themselves are pretty okay, especially the final battle which I will admit had me pretty on edge. 
 
Overall, I'd say it's a decent watch. For a military buff like myself it's definitely exciting to see the amazing detail put into the tanks despite the depiction of the physics being unrealistic, but I think that besides that it's quite simplistic. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I would think that it would be somewhat boring for someone who isn't a military buff (in saying that, someone who's a hardcore military buff will find themselves nitpicking the unrealistic aspects very often).

    When it comes to entitlement and birthright, Miho Nishizumi has a lot to be tankful for. Sorry, but I promised I’d make that joke at least once in this review, so at least it’s past us now. She hails from a family of highly trained, highly disciplined practitioners of one of their world’s most popular and prestigious forms of martial arts... Tankery. Yes, in this world, the most globally popular sport isn’t soccer, it’s full blown tank battles, and while it’s full extent is unknown, we do know that there’s a high school division that’s taught as a class, the students of which go to war with other schools in a yearly tournament. There are many nations taking part, and many different styles to contend with, but the Nishizumi family is at the top of the game. With the elegance of Wushu and the power of Krav Maga, the Nishizumi style of Tankery specializes in cold hearted dominance, seizing victory at the cost of all else, and with more than 18 tanks at their disposal, they had the force to overwhelm any opponent, even at the acceptable cost of several of their own units. 
 
However, there is a black sheep in every flock, and the youngest daughter of the Nishizumi family... The comparatively gentle Miho... Doesn’t quite agree with the all-or-nothing approach that her family has long treasured. One day, during an important tournament battle, she abandoned her own tank to save the lives of several of her teammates whose tank had fallen into a deep river. Unfortunately, she’d been driving the flag tank, so when the parked vehicle was shot by enemy fire, her school wound up losing the tournament. Disgraced for her heroism, Miho was spurned by her family, which she repudiated in return. In order to get away from Tankery forever, she transferred to a school that didn’t have that class on it’s curriculum. Little did she know that on her first day at this new school, Tankery class would be brought back, and the student council would all but blackmail her into signing up for it. With the very life she’d been running from having caught up with her, will Miho become the leader her family never saw in her, or will history repeat itself? 
 
Have I ever spoken about Actas before? Have I ever even heard of it before? I don’t think I have, which is understandable, because while they’ve done a ton of minor work on other studios’ projects, they really haven’t done that much on their own. From what I can tell, aside from Girls Und Panzer, the only major work they’ve done was the currently running Princess Principal, on which they shared duties with Studio 3hZ. They did Moetan and a few of what I understand are the less popular Transformers titles, but nothing else of any serious note, which is a shame, because I really like what they did with Panzer. I’ve never really had a problem with moe designs... Or ‘moe blobs,’ as they’re also sometimes called... But it’s kind of toned down here, taking a more grounded and natural approach to the big-eyed, chin-deprived features that are more closely associated with the trend. The moe design aesthetic works surprisingly well with the eponymous tank action, even if the animation doesn’t blend as smoothly as I’d like. 
 
See, Girls Und Panzer uses a mix of traditional two-dimensional and more modern three-dimensional animation, and both work really well, at least for the most part. The slice of life aspects of the series, AKA the girls when they’re not operating heavy machinery, are done using 2D animation, and while I wouldn’t say any of it’s bad, it does feel wildly inconsistent. A great deal of it uses limited movement and smart budget saving tricks, such as selective framing and frozen talking heads, but it wouldn’t be to a distracting or noticeable degree if it wasn’t for certain other scenes that are so over-animated that they feel almost like they were done using rotoscope. The tanks in the series are almost always shown in CG, and while their movements don’t always look convincing or well integrated, they both look and move like real tanks, and the level of detail used on them is stunning. Unfortunately, while both sides of the animation are more or less adequate, they can look a bit cringey when both are moving at the same time. 
 
You get a dose of this right in the first scene of the first episode, where we begin with a POV shot from inside one of the tanks, and we catch several glimpses of moe girls sticking their heads and whole bodies out of their respective tanks, and Good Lord does it look like an awkward combination. They just don’t move the same, and it doesn’t always look... Right. This gets better throughout the series, especially after they figure out that it looks much better to focus the camera on the girls while keeping the camera steady, negating any excess movement from the tanks so that they don’t have to move the girls with them, so it’s easy enough to get over. The character designs tend to get weirder as the cast expands, seeing how the main cast is geared towards normalcy with hairstyles that inform their personalities... The lazy girl has long thick hair, the delicate girl has lighter and fluffier black hair, the love-sick girl has hair that’s long, pampered orange locks, etc... But characters occupying the side tanks feature teams of military buffs, younger girls, girls who all look like clones of each other, so at least you can’t say they got lazy or uncreative with their moe blobs. 
 
The soundtrack, by Shiro Hamaguchi, is mostly set to the style of military march music, and if you want a quick comparison, there’s a track called Panzer Vor that, early on, sounds eerily similar to the theme song from Disney’s Recess. There’s a lot of rolling drums at the base of the music, and it’s overlayed by a handful of different wind instruments, your standard marching band fare. There are a few exceptions, such as in regards to foreign characters, like the British tune The British Grenadiers, which acts as a reverse of a lot of the more standard tunes, as it starts with the flute and then adds in the drums. There was initially a beautifully rendered version of an old Russian folk song on the soundtrack, but because Crunchyroll couldn’t get the rights to it, they had to replace it with something else Russian sounding from the public domain bin. They went, of course, with the Pac Man theme, which didn’t even come close. Another noteworthy track is the cast being forced to sing the Goosefish song, but it’s nothing without it’s insane dance visuals. Honestly though, the most noteworthy music that the dub was able to retain is the opening theme Dreamriser, from the band Chouco, which is absolutely delightful. 
 
The English dub is unfortunately on the disappointing side, as Sentai Filmworks apparently decided that instead of trying to match the moefied voice of the characters... A feat that, like an accurate kansai dialect, is distinctly possible to pull off but still highly difficult... They would instead use more normal, natural sounding American teenage girl voices, most of which hit a lower register than you’d expect from a glance at the characters, and it doesn’t work as well as you’d hope. To be fair, it does start to sound a lot better after a few episodes, especially as Meg McDonald, one of Sentai’s most recent hires at the time, manages to find a connection to her character that may have something to do with the character herself growing in confidence and comfort with each passing episode. Actually, a lot of the cast of this dub are unknown names and recent(at the time) hires, including Rebekah Stevens growing into her role of the excitable tank nerd Yukari and Molly Searcy... Well, honestly being a bit miscast as the sleepy and quiet Mako, as you can just tell she’s struggling to give the character personality despite the restrictions of a lower register. 
 
Caitlynn French was also hired around 2012-2013, but it’s arguable that she’s come a lot farther than her contemporaries since then, with plenty of notable star performances under her belt already, and even though she’s not playing the main character here, she plays around with the role of Hana, a girl trying to transition from the gentle delicacy of flower arrangement to the raw power of firing a tank cannon and finds a lot of character in this dynamic. There are a bunch of veteran actors in the cast, with recognizable voices like Monica Rial and Luci Christian popping up in the rest of the main tank class, and some incredibly talented names like Hilary Haag and Brittany Karbowski getting meatier parts as villains, but the most surprising for me was the boy-crazy Saori, and after stumping me for most of the first episode as I tried to place where I’ve heard her before, it hit me like a ton of bricks that she was played by voice acting veteran Jessica Calvello, who I honestly hadn’t heard in anything since 2003. 
 
I mean, okay, she had like 6 or 7 jobs between 2004 and 2013, but none of them were really high profile, and now, she’s getting lead roles left and right, and deservedly so, with fan favorite performances in Attack on Titan and Maria Holic, to name a few. I’ve mentioned in other reviews how excited I was to see her coming back in a major way to the dubbing industry, and her performance in this is probably it’s biggest saving grace. The first episode does sound a little awkward all around, but she’s the only main actor whom I can confidently say was putting forth maximum effort since the beginning. That’s not to say she makes the dub sound good, however, because the overall grounded voices coming out of characters that are slightly grounded but still over-the-top in design is a hard thing to get used to. Hell, the perfect example of this dub’s problems is the student council president, a short girl with tsundere pigtails whose voice is way too deep for her stature. It’s kinda worth checking out at least once to see what Sentai’s newest hires of this decade are capable of, and to celebrate Calvello’s triumphant return to action, but the sub is way better. 
 
Girls Und Panzer is what I like to call a Gimmick Anime. It’s not deep, it’s not high concept, it’s not a rip-off of anything more successful, it’s not following popular trends... It’s the kind of show(Well, manga, in this case) where the creator was able to come up with one weird, original concept and build a story, world and cast of characters around it. This may sound like a new concept for some of you, but if you think back, there have been plenty of Gimmick anime that have become successful over the years. High School of the Dead and Tiger and Bunny lit up the market back in their day, and over ten years later, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is still finding new ways to expand the universe it built off of it’s gimmick. All you really need to do is take your original idea, set it into a tried and true formula, populate it with archetypal or even subversive characters, and then find ways to market it, so that people get hooked on the new idea while being drawn in by the same old surroundings that the gimmick manages to cover up. 
 
If that sounds cynical of me, well, that’s because more often than not, Gimmick anime don’t always work, and there are a myriad of problems they can go through. For example, the gimmick can get stale, exposing the characters as running jokes who can no longer support it, which is what happened to Dagashi Kashi, at least in my opinion. You can focus on the gimmick to the point that the series loses it’s sense of direction, which is probably how Bento wound up going off the rails with two unwatchable and thankfully skippable episodes. You can focus way too hard on marketing, which led to Strike Witches going overboard on fanservice to an unforgivable degree, or you can try to make your gimmick show more than the sum of it’s parts and fail miserably, winding up looking stupid and pretentious as a result, like Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. If your main character IS the gimmick, you run the risk of sacrificing plot, story and the rest of the cast as props to support the exploits of said character, like Squidgirl did. Or you could be like C3, and pick a gimmick that feels way too disturbingly similar to real life tragedies. 
 
Okay, to be fair, Girls Und Panzer almost falls to that last issue, with tanks fortunately being a lot more removed from reality than lifelike toy guns and thus not nearly as uncomfortable to think about, but aside from that, it really doesn’t have any of those other problems. It fused it’s gimmick with one of the most enjoyable story structures you can pick, the ‘underdogs proving themselves in a tournament’ structure template, and in doing so, it was able to keep the story simple, hold to a consistent direction, keep it’s gimmick fresh with the increasing difficulty of each battle and the challenges both during and inbetween, and it had so much realism in the movement of the tanks and the tactical usage of terrain and strategy that they were able to get away with some otherwise ludicrous logic fallacies... Which, to be fair, was more for the sake of keeping the show from crossing the threshold from tank violence to actual human casualties. Yeah, I’ll believe a human sticking out of a tank is too small a target to hit, because a moe show like this one REALLY doesn’t need to get that dark. 
 
Of course, being a tournament style show that only has 12 episodes, it did wind up facing one other potential problem. Using Yuri on Ice as a begrudging example... Seriously, I really wanted to like that show more than I did... It’s entirely possible for a large cast to feel underdeveloped in a story that seems to be focused more on performance performance performance, with interchangeable stock characters just kind of existing for the sake of existing, and it’s just as possible for a show like that one to carry low or even no stakes. Again, though, this is a problem that Girls Und Panzer manages to avoid. The characterization is a bit light, with no individual characters having arcs outside of the tank battles, and the few that do exist being resolved for better or worse by a simple win/loss, and honestly, none of the characters... Not even in the main five... Are particularly memorable as individuals. Even the villains, who are a lot more fun to watch, are little more than stereotypes. 
 
Up until my second time through the series, this was my one major problem with it, but now that I’ve seen it again, the characters are developed... Enough. The main cast may not be made of definitive characters, but you know enough about them to like them and to know why they’re in the game, and what they’re getting out of it. They don’t go above and beyond, but it’s acceptable. They even change by the end, albeit in smaller and more subtle ways than some viewers will be used to. The supporting cast is largely interchangeable, but with the exception of some cosplayers towards the end, none of them feel wasted or unimportant. They even wind up getting small arcs to themselves, like when the bumbling underclassmen wind up scoring major achievements in the last fight. Besides, when you really get down to it, this isn’t a character based story... It’s mostly plot driven, and while it’s not going to break any barriers, a team of underdogs surrounded by less important but still kind of interesting stock characters while battling foreign stereotypes that still manage to pull out redeeming qualities whenever needed is a scenario that’s more than enough to support a tournament show. 
 
In other words, Girls Und Panzer’s biggest accomplishment is in execution. The parts for the most part don’t feel like anything special or revolutionary, but when it all comes together, you wind up with an intense, energetic sports anime that’s able to use likeable characters and smart writing to create a series of truly heart-pounding fights, full of devastating twists and sudden, unexpected challenges that you can’t help but cheer every after every single one that they overcome. I will admit that I had a lot of problems with the first episode, and I found it really despicable that the student council would use such cruel and extreme tactics to force Miho to take tankery, but even that becomes forgivable about halfway through the series when you realize that there isn’t just the joy of success and the developing bond of the tankery class on the line, oh no, there are actual stakes at play here, and the more you grow to love and identify with these characters, the more you’ll want them to overcome all odds and win it all. Not bad for a show that needed two inbetween ova episodes to help us keep up with all of it’s characters. 
 
Girls Und Panzer is available from Sentai filmworks. The inbetween episodes I just mentioned are all available on the home release. A six episode OVA series is also available from the same company, along with another OVA and the first of seven feature films, although I’ve seen none of these, so I can’t speak as to their quality. Two different manga series, Girls Und Panzer and Girls Und Panzer Little Army, are available stateside from publisher Seven Seas. There are actually a ton of different manga titles (and one game) that aren’t available stateside, along with one light novel, but I’m sure we’ll get them eventually. 
 
Girls Und Panzer is by no means a masterpiece, but it still had every excuse in the book to not be as great as it is. Not only was it saddled with a production team that hasn’t done anything else of note until this year, it was also limited to 12 episodes and almost as many named characters as Fullmetal Alchemist had, and despite these problems, the final product is nothing short of amazing. It has some flaws, but aside from the easily excusable logic and safety issues, the only problems that hold me back from giving it a perfect score are the occasionally shakey animation and the handful of character arcs that get resolved way too easily at the end. None of these problems keep the series from being a blast from start to finish, nor do they manage to derail that overall feeling that the people working on it fully enjoyed what they were doing and believed in it with complete sincerity. I know a world where recreational tank battles have achieved world-wide popularity is a hard concept to imagine, but this series makes me believe in it one hundred freaking percent. It’s exciting, it’s smart, it’s suspenseful, and it’s honestly one of those rare titles that I’d recommend to just about anyone. I give Girls Und Panzer a 9/10.

    Girls und Panzer is a military, school anime created by Actas. The anime has 12 episodes and aired from October 9th, 2012 to March 25th, 2013.  
 
Storyline (8/10) 
 
Girls und Panzer follows high schooler, Miho Nishizumi and her friends as they practice Sensha-do, the martial arts of tanks/Panzers. Miho’s school, Oarai high school takes part in a national Sensha-do championship after the student council revived the art. While Miho is from a family well known in the art, trauma from her previous school holds her back from wanting to participate in the competition. In the end she joins her new friends as they try to win the championship and faces a number of different schools, all of which used different Panzers from around the world. The story is well paced for the most part but feels rushed half way into the season. One part that feels rushed is when Miho and friends, make it out they in for a hard fight but the viewer never gets to see it and only told that Oarai won.  
 
Art (8/10) 
 
The presentation of the Panzers in the show is very well done, as attention to detail of each Panzer makes it easy for the viewer to tell each Panzer apart. The animation of Panzer fights is great, as each Panzer moves realistically. The characters themselves are also designed well, as each character has a unique look to himself/herself, making it easy to tell who’s who.  
 
Sound (8/10) 
 
The uses of real life Panzer sounds, from the sound of the engine to the firing of shells, helps bring the show to life. The opening song, ""DreamRiser"" by Choucho and the ending song, ""Enter Enter MISSION!"" by Ankou Team, sounds great and creates a more joyful mood for the anime. The characters' voices have been used in an interesting way and as each school is based in a different country, the characters speaks with variegated accents and uses Panzers unique to its country.  
 
Characters (8/10) 
 
Miho Nishizumi, voiced by Mai Fuchigami – She is Ankou team’s commander and the leader of her school’s team. She is from a well-known Sensha-do family, but has tried to avoid Panzers ever since a traumatic event took place at her last school, She is also very caring about her friends' feelings and is always considerate. 
 
Saori Takebe, voiced by Ai Kayano – She is Ankou team’s radio operator. She is one of the people who befriends Miho on her first day. She joins Miho in Sensha-do in an attempt to become more popular with the guys. 
 
Hana Isuzu, voiced by Mami Ozaki – She is Ankou team’s Gunner. She also befriends Miho on her first day. She was unhappy with her way of life, and decidesed to take up Sensha-do with her friends in order to change her life. After a while, she falls in love with her team’s Panzer main gun. (The love part seems like a spoiler XD) 
 
Yukari Akiyama, voiced by Ikumi Nakagami – She is Ankou team’s loader. She is Panzer otaku and has a vast knowledge of them, which is helpful for her team.  
 
Mako Reizei, voiced by Yuka Iguchi – She is Ankou team’s driver. She is a quiet and gloomy girl, who is always late to school because she hates mornings. She can instantly learn anything by reading, but even though she is top in class, she does Sensha-do to earn more credits to make up for her being late all the time. 
 
Enjoyment (8/10) 
 
I found Girls und Panzer to be an enjoyable anime to watch; while it wasn’t mind blowing or one of the best I've ever watched, it still had great elements. I found the story to be interesting, even though some parts felt rush, like the hype fight that the viewer never sees. The attention to detail on the Panzers is great and brings them to life for the viewer. The characters also had a lot of work put into them as they behavior and speech patterns reflect which school and country they are from.  
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
In the end Girls und Panzer is an anime that while isn’t one of best you can watch, it still delivers a good story and some good action with Panzers fighting each other. As such, if you like Panzers, young girls fighting or are looking to try something different, then I recommend giving Girls und Panzer a try.

    I honestly shouldn't have liked this anime. From the sadly large amount of anime I've watched, you'd think I'd know to stay away from something that I can only describe as ""moe tanks."" However, I gave into my friend's harping, and sat down and took this predictable yet intriguing show in all at once, and: I'd recommend it.  
 
Story: 7 
Hear me out. The show's story revolved around a group of high school girls (who go to school on some sort of floating town carrier ship?) as they try to win the tankery championship. This sounds completely ridiculous. It is. Yet, the staff managed to weave this completely...inconceivable...and ill-developed story into something that seemed fully plausible. By the end of it, I felt like I was watching any regular sports anime. I found myself invested in the concept of the story by one simple line in the first episode that goes something like, ""It's a bit weird to think of a guy doing tankery. It's so feminine!"" It dragged me into this world where nothing was really explained, and tankery was somehow exclusively female (like American football, I guess). I give this a 7 because the show managed to leave me thinking about tankery like it was an average sport, never mind the weird floating ships of schools. It was such a uniquely weird topic, that I became invested in learning about tanks, which I knew nothing of before. I paid attention, I learned, and I was dragged in.  
 
Art: 7 
The dimensions on the girls' faces when side-facing annoyed me to no end. Other than that, the art was generally moe. I would give it a 5 or 6 if I wasn't so impressed by the movements of the tanks and how they were animated. Seriously, I found myself staring at their almost-meticulous detailing rather than the girls' faces.  
 
Sound: 4 
I hate moe soundtracks, and that's exactly what this had. It was a bit forcedly feminine, but neither the OP or ED were what I'd call ""bad."" They were average. The background music throughout the series was also average. The only thing I found remarkable was this kind-of weird rendition of some characters singing a Russian war song...alright. 
 
Character: 6 
The character developments were all completely predictable. Common family in-fighting, get's resolved, everyone's more or less content. Some crying here and there. There were so many girls in this show, that the 12 episodes couldn't really explore any of their personalities or backgrounds in depth other than a few main characters. Even those were pretty surface level. Honestly, only one of the main characters stood out to me (the poofy-haired one), but I can't even remember her name, because, at the end of the day, the show threw so many names at me that I only remembered the protagonist's name. The protagonist, Miho, was a fairly average trope, but I enjoyed her more than I thought because the show didn't resort to all of the typical cliches with her, and she displayed great battle acumen by the end of the show. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
I KNOW. A 9. UGH. This seems uncalled for, and it is. The story really, seriously, drew me in. I ended up on, like, 20 tank Wikipedia pages and was Youtubing videos of M4 Shermans firing by the end of the show. The fact that I was pulled in from the beginning into treating the show like a sports anime made it, honestly, insanely fun to watch matches. I knew what the outcome of each of them would be, but the team who created this seriously researched their military stuff. The tactics were fun and realistic, the tanks moved in a captivating way, and the enemies were all unique. I felt the care that went into production for this show, and I loved watching it all unfold. This show presented a unique combination of something like a soccer anime and a historical war anime, and had me smiling in every match.  
 
Overall: 7 
Ultimately, though I seriously enjoyed it, the I think that this show failed to expand on the possibilities that it had to work with. The characters lacked depth, and the outcome of everything from the character drama to the match outcomes were highly predictable. Nothing was really outstanding other than the unique story. Still, the weirdness of the story managed to pull everything else up with it, and I found myself at the edge of my seat for the matches, even though I thought this would be some moe sports anime that was meant to appeal to military-game fans. 
 
Receiving a solid 7, I recommend this anime for anyone looking for a unique and somehow refreshing mishmash of sports, military, and moe.

    Girls und Panzer (lit. „Girls and Tanks“) is the most successful anime so far of the comparatively  unknown studio Actas. It was released in 2012 and pretty much offers exactly what the name indicates. 
 
It´s about a fictional sport called tankery and centers around Miho Nishizumi, who tries to lead her  academy to victory in a big annual tournament and not much else. If you expect mainly a Slice of Life with cute girls doing cute stuff, than you will be surprised with what this anime actually does. While cute girls are indeed all you will see for the whole show, the producers focused very heavily on the fictional sport of tankery. Almost the entire series consists of the matches as well as the preparations for the matches. 
 
This makes Girls und Panzer a comedic  action show, and it is actually one worth watching too. The story moves along at a nice pace and despite the heavy focus on the sport itself, you also will see some nice character development too. The supporting characters are highly entertaining and funny, especially those from abroad. 
 
If the various stereotypes surrounding the other academies are funny or just annoying is probably completely up to the viewer. Personally I had a good laugh about all these clichés thrown at me (like the English team drinking tea all the time and so on), but it might be a turnoff for others.  
 
The biggest flaw of this series, apart from the easily predictable outcome of the matches,  is clearly the animation.  Actas tried their best but they do not have the budget bigger studios have and it shows. While they put a lot of love for details in the tanks themselves (which are all after real tanks used in world war II), the same cannot be said for the backgrounds, and the faster scenes stutter a little bit too.  
 
However, I honestly don´t think this should keep anyone from watching this anime. It´s highly entertaining, it´s only 12 episodes and hey…most importantly it´s girls driving tanks and blowing stuff up! Which guy wouldn´t wanna see this? 
 
If you like the TV series, Girls und Panzer also offers you quite a bit of bonus material and extras. There is an extended episode on the match against Anzio (which is the only one not fully shown in the TV series) and also six OVAs for those who would like to learn more about the tanks featured throughout the series. Also watch out for a two hour long movie coming out in November this year! 
 
I give Girls and Panzer a solid 7 and also recommend to watch this subbed rather then dubbed.

    Like a lot of people, Girls und Panzer is a show that didn't succeed in catching my attention at first. Not because I don't like cute; personally, I seldom get tired of cute anime girls doing cute things. No, Girls und Panzer was a hard sell for me just because the premise seemed so weird. Cute girls mixed with military weaponry is fun, but shouldn't they be fighting some great threat a la Strike Witches? Having tank combat just be a school club activity for the girls, It just seemed odd to me somehow, so I wasn't sure about it and ultimately held off. As time went on, I kept hearing about the series though and my interest started to get piqued. Eventually I had to check it out for myself. Doing so now, I can see quite clearly what the fuss is all about. Girls und Panzer is an anime worth getting excited over. 
 
Girls und Panzer is also an exceedingly simple anime. You couldn't get much more simple. The titles says it all here as you have girls and you have panzers. The premise is just a little weird, yes, but they set it up well enough that it's soon not anything to really think about. Girls fight each other with tanks as a martial art in this anime's world. There really isn't so much else to it; the story of the series is exceptionally mundane. It's basically the ultimate cliche sports story; underdog school team has to overcome impossible odds and win the big tournament or else their school will get shut down. It's something we've all seen before and the nuances to it are limited. Yet while not heavy or original in story, Girls und Panzer is far from a poorly written or dumb anime. On the contrary, when dealing with what it wants to focus on, it is never anything but exceptional. What it happens to want to focus on are girls and panzers. 
 
When it comes to girls, Girls und Panzer has a ton. You need multiple girls to run a tank and tank battles call for multiple tanks, so that means lots of girls to get to know. Of course, Girls und Panzer is a 12 episode anime so obviously it doesn't have the time to flesh out characters for quite so many girls; in most cases each tank team is characterized simply; you got one tank jam packed full of cute first year students, another tank commanded by the school's history nerds and so on. This works to bring life to the minor characters while not requiring they be developed at length individually. Leaders of the opposing tank teams are developed similarly through associations with the nation they're school are supposed to represent.  
 
Aside from maybe the student council tank team, however, most of the actual character development is spared for the tank team of the main characters. The five central characters are all fairly well defined. The main character, Miho, is a typical if inherently likable one; stronger and more collected than she seems, but also reticent and in need of her friends for support. Mako, the driver, is detached and sleepy but compassionate. Saori, the radio operator is energetic and friendly. Hana, the gunner is gentle and soft spoken, but also strong and willful. Yukari, the loader, is the kind of goofy one who is also a big panzer nerd. The character development each receives individually is limited to a few sequences each, but they develop a lot together through each tank battle, and as more time is spent with these characters they becoming increasingly endearing. They're the sort of characters it's hard not to root for. 
 
The girls are key, but the tanks are about equally important. I don't really know anything about tanks, but lots of research has clearly gone into the specifics of them, which really strengthens just how they are rendered and used. The battles are complex and involving. This is where the show shines its best. Battle sequences, for me are one of the most difficult things to engage me with, but the battles in Girls und Panzer were never dull and in fact had me watching with anticipation to see just how the girls would pull it off. These sequences are the true heart of the show; they're where the girls grow the most, where they're the most in their element and where the show's genius is allowed to shine through. Truly some of the most memorable and satisfying battle sequences I can recall in any anime. 
 
The show also looks excellent. The tank battles exciting and well animated, with CG well incorporated. The later battles in particular are gorgeous, the snow battle being my particular favorite. The girls are also well drawn and usually well animated. It's also well acted and uses music to great effect, especially in the battles. Both opening and ending themes are cute and memorable. The presentation on a whole is pretty exceptional. 
 
Everything about Girls und Panzer is a lot of fun. It's kind of a difficult anime not to get sucked into. The girls are cute and endearing and the tank battles are intense and impressive. It does everything so well it's very easy to forgive it's slight and unremarkable story. Fans of tanks and fans of girls will find a nothing but rewarding experience.

    Toriko is one those Shonen battle anime like DBZ, Naruto, One piece, Bleach, etc... But whats makes this different this series is that the mayor point in the story is to eat food to gain more power, to be more accurate the main characters have this thing call gourmet cell inside their bodies that certain food will give them power up's when eaten. The main character are these gourmet hunters that travel around the world founding good food to eat, sometimes they have to fight monsters, other time they have to fight the environment and there time that they fight with other humans. The sound and the animation are really good with this anime is no master piece but it has it moments when you see a really good food that will make you hungry just by looking at it. I will recommend anyone who loves Shonen battle anime to give this one a go, but be ware this anime continue in the manga.

    GUTS ! GUTS GUTS ! GUTS GUTS ! 
 
As toriko became one of my favorite anime, I had to write a review to explain why. 
 
Imagine a world, much more bigger than earth, that seems endless, where you can find an infinite number of natural cooking's ingredients. Some of them are very rare and valuable, and that's why, there are people whose job is to hunt them.  
 
We often follow toriko and komatsu (a boy whose dream is to become one of the best cook in the world) in their epic adventures to find and ingredient. It could as well be a terrifying and powerful monster or small mushroom that live in a place very hard to reach. Every arcs is surprising and imaginative. 
 
The plot is simple, no headache to understand here, but very interesting and original. A world where cooking is much more important than everything else. Famous people are cooks, even the government is involved in foods, restaurants, ingredients, cooking tv show...etc 
 
Toriko follow the shonen's rules. He become much more stronger in each episode, and is able to hunt ingredients of higher quality. 
 
Colored graphics are beautifull. Most of the time, the story take place in natural environment. You'll feel like traveling. 
 
This anime is really addictive. 
 
Gochisousama deshita :)

    So... We have food and fighting.Some people may think food fight but they are way off.This anime by ""Shimabukuro Mitsutoshi"" delivers a wide range of combinations and flavor that is hard to imagine.However once you do,you're ready to jump into battle with the characters just to try and sneak a bite of the overwhelming varieties of food.""Toriko"" ended up being the first food anime i watched,after episode 1 i had to show people so i called up some friends.We started the first episode and didn't stop until 15 or so,from that point we watched it every time we hung out.The story was easily captivating enough to keep us entertained and wanting more.The fights gradually get better and better as it goes.All around ""Toriko"" is a fun and memorable crowd pleasing anime,that is of course if you like ""DBZ""""One piece"" mixed with food.As ""Funimation"" says,you should be watching. Warning this anime may make you hungry,even if you're full!!!

    Honestly if you watch this without thinking too much about it you well get a pretty normal shonen anime. The only character I have too much of a problem with is Komatsu, as alot of people say. 
 
Now, he is not a detestable character and I do not loathe him, although I do hate incompetence he displays at times. However I do believe that they should have made Komatsu a women, this would have drastically changed the dynamic of the story and probably have made it better. 
 
Now, I read somewhere that the author had intended at first to make Komatsu a woman, but in doing so would create a reverse harem, because of the time she would spend with Toriko and his brothers. However I still believe that would have been the better choice for it would have changed the dynamic of the entire show making a female Komatsu a love interest for Toriko.  
 
Other than that, everything was fine, it wasn't AMAZING, but it was average at best, and there is plenty of action as well. I thought it was alirght, it is worth watching so yeah.

    If you like food... and like watching tv shows about food... this anime is for you, despite 99% of the food in this anime not existing my stomach growls every time I watch Toriko... and before I know it I have my face in a tray of Nacho's HA! 
Toriko will take you on what is best described as a laid back gourmet adventure and you will love every minute of it... WARNING: make sure you have plenty of food on hand ;)

    A somewhat familiar anime to audiences of the One Piece journey. With that being said, ""somewhat"" is the keyword. 
 
The story, is simply juicy and riveting. Similar to One Piece, Toriko is made up of an immensely gargantuan world filled with many surprises, wonders, and mysteries.  
 
The art is on par with any modern era Japanese anime. The emphasis and exaggeration on the food (especially ""key"" food items) is mouth watering. You'll soon find yourself engulfed in a sparkling, tender, and juicy piece of prime rib. The environment and color of the anime is beautiful and breathtaking at times.  
 
The sound, is decent. The OP and ED could be much better as the music is not very catchy.  
 
The characters, need to develop more. I know the anime is called ""Toriko"" but I don't feel a close bond with any of the characters yet. With that being said, the story has A LOT of room to develop so they have plenty of time to fix this issue.  
 
Pros - Food is very well detailed and exaggerated (in a good way of course :D). World is vast which makes room for a HUGE adventure and a LONG lasting series. The art and environment is absolutely beautiful!  
 
Cons - Character development/connection not there (may take some time, be patient), awkward fight scenes (if you are used to Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece fight scenes you may be disappointed, but bear in mind this anime does not fail on some cool combat moves in here), OP and ED need to go.  
 
Overall, if you love food and a world filled with mysterious creatures, give this anime a shot! 
8 out of 10.

    I bet you’re wondering “how can a shounen about food be interesting”. I thought the same thing until I watched it, and honestly it completely blew my expectations away... at first. I’ll explain what I mean later 
 
Pros: 
- Unique concept and setting (Can you name another battle manga about food?) 
- Godly world building. Seriously, it’s one of the best in anime/manga  
- Amazing, brutal action sequences 
- The hype is over 9000!! 
 
These are the only pros I can think of for Toriko unfortunately, because i felt this series had a lot more flaws. 
 
Plot: 3/10 
 
The story takes place in the Gourmet age, a world where people live and explore  various delicious foods to eat. Our main protagonist Toriko, and his partner Komatsu explore the world to find rare and exquisite ingredients, to accomplish Toriko’s dream of creating the best full course meal. Toriko’s the gournet hunter who hunts for food and defeats any enemies that comes their way, meanwhile Komatsu’s the chief who prepares the food.  
 
The plot is simple and repetitive e.g. Toriko and co. go on a quest to find a food-> Toriko arrives and has to fight some monster who doesn’t actually give af about the food-> villains shows up, Toriko fights them and wins-> Toriko gets a powerup from eating said food, then decides if he’ll put it on his full course. Rinse repeat for 150 episodes and you have Toriko 
 
There’s a lot of nonsensical powerups our 4 heavenly kings receive that become forgotten after the arc they’re introduced, the calories aspects to moves gets dropped.  
 
Characters: 5/10 
 
There’s a diverse, large cast of characters, but they lack basic characterisation and meaningful character development. Our main characters, the four heavenly kings are just as bad in this aspect because they’re really static and never really grow or change much throughout the course of the series. The villains are poorly written and generic. 
 
Animation: 1/10 
 
The show has bad animation, its heavily censored, the fights aren’t as brutal or have any blood as it goes on, and it’s filled with filler.  
 
Overall: 1/10 
 
The Toriko anime is shit. 
They introduced a anime only character (Tina), made her important as a “canon character” by having her tag along with Toriko and Co’s adventures when she wasn’t needed. The anime leaves out a lot of the description which enriches the lore and makes the world building so great.   
 
If you really want to start Toriko, I recommend reading the manga from the beginning.

    Okay, so to start I originally watched the first 20ish episodes of Toriko a couple years ago but then put it down because it just wasn't that appealing to me. Two weeks ago I decided to pick up the manga because I heard it was better than the anime. Still skeptical I powered past what happened in the anime, in the manga. After that, it was all downhill for me.  
 
I read through over 300 chapters of Toriko in a week. The characters and progressing story had me going through dozens of chapters a day. While the concept of a food world/combat may be a turn off for some, Toriko utilizes this to a high degree making each arc dynamic and different. I would highly recommend anyone to read this shonen. And I also recommend people to stay away from the anime because of the inconstancies between the show and manga, lack of brutality (edited out for child viewers), and also length. The anime only goes up to the Gourmet Festival. 
 
I am really enjoying Toriko and I feel it still has its best work ahead of it!  
 
PLEASE READ THE MANGA!!! And if you do watch the anime first, then watch it, then pick up the manga. I promise you it is totally worth it.

    WARNING: Anime doesn't cover all of the manga. Toriko is a series where MANLY MEN have gritty fights against villains & monsters for the sake of heroism & food. 
 
Many people have told me how much they hated the anime & prefer reading its manga, which is fine but I'm here to give my honest opinions about the animes pros & cons.  
 
Toriko's concept is one of hunting & cooking where our heroes ""The 4 Heavenly Kings"" (Toriko, Coco, Sunny & Zebra) explore the unknown lands of the Gourmet Age where exotic food stimulates power resulting into a war which purpose is to obtain ""GOD""; the most sacred dish on the planet. 
 
As a story, Toriko slowly builds up into hype moments where strength is taken to gargantuan levels & takes careful consideration of minor details which later deliver in the payoff in both exposition & combat. Most arcs can range from exploring, fighting or just eating which can vary per viewer but thankfully there aren't any major filler arcs that affect the overall story. (Most of them just range from stand alones or 2 eps) 
 
Similar to Dragon Ball & One Piece, Toriko carries that same adventurous feel & welcomes its viewer into a imaginative world filled with unique animals & technology. A highlight of the series are its subtle references to Fist of The North Star with Toriko, Coco & Zebra being based on Kenshiro, Toki & Raoh among other things.  
 
As expected of battle shonens the series does deliver on fights sadly most of these battles do contain watered down violence. This is the main reason why most people just ignore the anime yet the adaptation serves better as a gateway due to its few crossovers with One Piece along with its soundtrack & usage of atmosphere in either the laid back scenes or the intense ones. 
 
Flaws of the anime include its later decrease in animation quality around the 100s & the filler ending to the series as the manga is still ongoing. Also I'm certain characters such as Komatsu & Tina will affect viewing experience in a negative way. While I suggest to do what you think is better (watching or reading) please give the series a chance as it was only recently in 2013 where people began to become fans of the series. While some scenes can feel dragged & its food concept ridiculous, don't forget that even Dragon Ball pokes fun in itself due its name choices (such as Trunks, Dr. Briefs, Tambourine, Drum & Piano).  
 
Don't let misconceptions affect your judgement as you may end up liking the series whether you watch or read it. Toriko is not the greatest series but does pay tribute to shonens of the 80s & 90s where it follows a straight forward story that offers imagination, gritty battles, monstrous villains & heroic characters.

    Most people have told me they find the idea of Toriko to be stupid. After first, I had my doubts. ""How could a show about cooking have made its way up the latter in SJ?"" 
 
Oh boy, was I in for a ride.  
 
The best thing about this show, it combines old style fighting anime with a twist. The daily fight to find something new and exciting to tempt your tastebuds! The idea is probably one of the most original ideas I have ever seen. The exaction is well done and absolutely hilarious as I find myself laughing and cheering at every turn. 
 
Biggest issue seems to be the character designs. I'm sorry but, I adore them! I love the hideously eyesore like costumes and the ridiculous hair! My favorite character is Sunny and he's the most ridiculous of all! I think it as a fun edge to the show. 
 
In fact, I love the whole cast! From the ever hungry and cheerful Toriko, the curious and skillful Komatsu, the kind and gentlemanly Coco, the determined Tina, the cute and loyal Terry, the outgoing and passionate Rin, and, of course, the Beauty freak with a straight forward, self-centered nature, Sunny! 
 
Its seriously the most colorful (and I mean that both figuratively and literally) cast of characters I've come across.  
 
What can I say? I thoroughly enjoy certainly made a fan out of me! I plan to keep watching!

    How do you completely ruin a manga adaptation? Well, it looks like the creators of this anime have the right answer, because like they did their best to make this anime fail. 
I mean, let's talk about it for a moment, what didn't they do? 
Filler Characters: they added unnecessary filler characters and changed the storyline sometimes so the filler character could play a role in canon episodes. Why would anyone even do that? 
Not enough? 
Well, they also made sure to censor all the blood, I mean, almost getting killed and yet just having a few scratches is just natural! 
Wait, still not enough for you? 
Toriko smokes in the manga, and that's actually pretty cool, but well, apparently the creators of the anime didn't find it cool enough, because Toriko doesn't seem to be smoking in the anime! 
And the awfully lazy art, oh god, don't get me started on this... 
Bottom line: 
Even the nice soundtrack couldn't cover up for all the terrible mistakes they made while adapting this manga into an anime show.

    The story of Toriko takes place in the Gourmet Age. In that world people live to eat. Wars can erupt over delicious food.  The main character Toriko and his partner Komatsu travel around the world to find exquisite ingredients. Toriko hunts, his partner cooks. This is the basic premise and I’ll be honest, it sounds stupid. Teenage heroes of other anime are trying to save humanity, planets, their family and friends from cool-looking edgy evil forces. But Toriko, a twenty five years old adult male, is chasing after food. It isn’t primarily a comedy anime to excuse the premise. Although soon it becomes clear that evil people can use rare food for their evil ends, it still isn’t enough to make most viewers take Toriko seriously.  
 
I’d like people to watch it but I will be honest. Toriko is mediocre at best. Despite its simple and not-too-intelligent premise, the story unfolds itself and turns out to be very complicated. For the first time in the history of shounen anime, the main character’s voracious appetite has a convincing reason: some people in this world have gourmet cells which can evolve and ultimately level up as they consume high-quality food.  Because these cells demand an immense amount of energy, characters usually eat a lot. This constant need for better food makes the story dynamic. Villains and heroes vie for the best food to become stronger which opens up possibilities of immense change. As they get stronger, they search for the ultimate food that can make one the most powerful. Thus, many different groups, both righteous and evil, clash with each other over food. As the story progresses it gets very complex but nothing is out of control, the anime preserves its integrity. In other words, the basic premise is nicely developed. 
 
The animation successfully creates its original world. There’s a lot of talk on food. The beast and plants of the world are an amalgamation of different species of ours. They often look childish.  Moreover, the world is very colorful. Bright colors are preferred for animation. This adds to the childish aura of the anime. Nevertheless, the animation is well done. Colorful scenes make fight scenes more fluid and add an extra dimension. As it’s expected from all 100+ episodes anime series, the budget of each episode is low. But when it comes to major fights it does not disappoint. Nothing top notch, yet well done.  
 
The sound is not exceptional either. Voice acting is well done. It brings out what it aims to do. Music is not so great as to be memorable. It still fits the general mood of the anime. You don’t feel like songs are out of place.  
 
One positive side of Toriko is that it doesn’t have many filler episodes. The number of filler episodes is 18 (13% of total) which is significantly lower than almost all long-running anime. 
 
Toriko isn’t great at character department either. Though many characters are usual clichés, there are some positively peculiar ones among them. One positive thing is that they are older than 21. This is consciously chosen because they usually consume a lot of alcoholic beverages. However, it isn’t used in a meaningful way. They don’t differ much from younger shounen heroes. The main character Toriko is a nice lead. What he lacks, his partner Komatsu provides. They complete each other (sadly, this isn’t a love story). Toriko’s friends Sani, Coco shine in terms of power. The anime does not fall into the trap of overpowered main character standing alone against the enemy, reducing the rest to a bunch of useless spectators who are there only to get impressed by the main character. Also, female characters do not have overgrown breasts, an oddity in this age. 
 
Overall, I enjoyed Toriko. Unlike other shounen, it requires a little more patience to be immersed in its world. But it’s painfully mediocre.

    WARNING: In my Review I go on tangents, but that's just the way I roll because I like barbeque sauce on my chicken nuggets. And don't you forget it. 
 
There are two reasons that I watch anime: 
 
1) I want to see something with depth that is intellectually stimulating where the characters and story weave a fascinating tale with twists and turns. One Anime that did this for me was Kaiji. 
 
2) I just want to relax and experience an enjoyable adventure with a memorable cast of characters. In this category I mostly look for the theme and eye candy (meaning the quality of the art). 
 
I watch Toriko for the second reason. 
 
I actually tried watching Toriko when it first came out and didn't like it. With this season being one of the worst seasons of anime for me I decided to give Toriko another chance. And I am REALLY glad that I did. 
 
Summary/Review: 
Toriko takes place during the ""Gourmet Age"" where food is not merely a delicacy but also a sought after commodity. In this world rare and exquisite food exists and is often extremely hard to attain. There are two main factions, the IGO, (which are a bunch of Gourmet Hunters) and an evil group (Bishikokai or something like that) who desire to control the food supply because food is essentially power. 
 
Characters 8/10 
Not the best characters nor the most memorable. However, they do have their moments and grow on you. 
 
Story 9/10 
Hilarious. It's about food, and food is power. 
 
Visuals 10/10 
Looks awesome. Nice fight scenes. 
 
Misc. 10/10 
I love the pacing and feel that almost every episode gives me my money's worth rather than feeling cheated and held at gunpoint like with many other Anime. 
 
 
Random Thoughts/Comparisons: 
I thought One Piece was good. Then I later realized I liked Fairy Tail better. The reason I like Fairy Tail better is because, while very similar, it does not suffer as much from ""Dragon Ball Z syndrome"". One Piece just takes soooo long to get its point across and it drags on and on. It's awesome but the lengthening just dilutes what could be greatness and it's frustrating. 
 
Then I realized I like Toriko better than Fairy Tail. While Fairy Tail's pacing is good, Toriko's pacing is phenomenal. It doesn't drag out arcs. It moves fast and leaves you wanting more rather than hanging for weeks on end (like One Piece). 
 
Toriko is stereotypical. It's almost how Dragon Ball Z would be if it centered around food and had ridiculously enjoyable pacing. As a matter of fact, Toriko is what I always wished Dragon Ball Z had been. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
The art is beautiful and imaginative. Some of the monsters are huge and give off vibes of epicness. It's just such an enjoyable Anime to chill back and watch. Turn your brain off and just enjoy mindless action with its beautiful visuals. If you try and take it seriously you will definitely not enjoy it. But if you don't take it seriously you are truly in for a full course meal... 
 
P.S.  
I usually don't care to write reviews but I hope that a few people read this and give Toriko a chance because it doesn't get the credit it deserves. I was one of the many who overlooked this gem. 
 
If Komatsu ends up getting Gourmet Cells I will say this is the best Anime ever!

    ""Cooking is as masculine as judo, kickboxing or tae kwan do. Anyone can fight but it takes a special man to craft the perfect Bolognese sauce"" 
Quoted from a manly midget chef... 
 
You know the first thing that crossed my mind when I read that quote was covering a cow with ketchup then proceed to pound the cow into bolognese sauce.  
Im just kidding of course, that isn't call MANLY... that's called animal abuse... 
 
So chances are if you stumble upon this anime, you're not watching it just to fill up your boring life with some boring junk. No.. You hunt for exotic food on a daily basis. And you need an anime that teaches you the RIGHT way to do it...  
Well, introducing Toriko, the only anime currently airing that will not only satisfy that hunger urge but will also teach you how to be more MANLY than you were before. 
 
What would you say if I said that World Peace could be obtain if everyone in the world combined their powers to produced the most delicious full course menu in the universe? 
You would probably say ""BURRRRRP!!"" Cause that's how the end of World Hunger sounds like. Now all that's left is the homeless people. 
 
(Now people, feeding the homeless to the hungry would solve those two world problems, but we wouldn't want to resort to cannibalism now do we?) 
 
Let's see how this anime can be used to solve other problems? 
 
Problem (Art) 
So you just opened up an art gallery and you're not raking any cash because an art gallery is partially a public good. (No duh..) 
Solution: 
Open up a mini restaurant in your gallery. Watch Toriko (especially the one piece crossover) and get inspiration on drawing animals which apparently looks like it had sex with food and produced offspring. Make your visitors hungry and they'll pay a visit to your mini restaurant for brunch. Problem solved  
Toriko has a huge variety of animal species, though not as much as Pokemon which has a total of 600++ up to date, but at least some of them are edible and each is designed with it's own unique features. The artwork for Toriko is similar to One Piece. If you like One Piece, then you definitely would love this. If you like Two Piece then go to the toilet... *crickets* Yeah, yeah lame joke... pfft... 
 
Problem (Sound) 
So you work with a bunch of unmotivated voice actors who does english dubs for an anime. 
And they sound horrible (more than usual anyways) 
Solution: 
Get them to watch Toriko. The seiyuus for this anime are top notch. They portray their character well in the anime. It's like the directors forced the seiyuus to starve during the recording to make them sound like a bunch of hungry men. What can I say about the opening? One word... ""GATSU!!"" No seriously, it's like getting your guts punched with a thousand fists of manliness. 
 
Problem (Character) 
So you have a son, and he's a wimp. Nothing wrong about that, but he is due to national service soon. And you don't want the other kids to bully him. 
Solution: 
Get him to watch Toriko. Make him into a man. Toriko is an exampled role model.He says his prayers before and after eating his meal. How often do you see people say their grace before they eat? Not only that, Toriko only kills animals that he deems worthy to be eaten. He does not just willy nilly kill any of God's creation. Only a REAL man could do that. 
For every manly character, there will have to be a less manly guy to enhance the manliness of the main character. 
For Batman, there is Robin. For Sherlock Holmes, there is Dr. Watson. In this case, for Toriko, there is Komatsu. Komatsu has his own set of special culinary abilities that furthur compliments Toriko's manliness. If Toriko was the fork and spoon, Komatsu is probably the condiments.  
What about the wimpy son problem? 
Heck, just show the government his MAL profile that he is currently watching ""Toriko"" He'll be exempted for life. 
In fact, ""Toriko"" isn't really an anime. 
The German government classified ""Toriko"" as ""Handbuch für Männlichkeit"" 
Translation, Handbook for masculinity. Yeah, everything sounds manlier in German. 
 
The only problem about this anime is that it was further degraded from its masculinity compared to the manga due to a significant degree of censorship. Lower your hopes for gore and blood. On the bright side, with the absence of graphic violence, how kids who haven't hit puberty can watch the anime and start training the the path of manliness... 
 
Overall, as proven above, watching Toriko solves a whole tons of problems. I give this anime a rating of 8. Cause that's the number of packs you'll have after watching this anime. Yes, that's right, 8 packs! One more pack and you can play tick-tack-toe on your abs. How awesome is that? Not as awesome as Toriko though. Tough luck kiddo.

    This review contains spoilers. 
 
I've mentioned before that if you don't want to slog through 26-50 episodes of a TV series, watch the movie version. Well, here you can watch the movie first, get an idea of the show, and if you enjoyed it, watch the TV series and OVA. Why? The prologue leading up to the title frame is an excellent primer to the franchise. There was something similar in the first episode of the show, but on a much smaller budget. The prologue in the film takes place (probably) between the two seasons of the show, featuring the cool and yet ahistorical alliance between the Allies and Germany, er, Karlsland. After showing the joint armies and navies getting shredded by the Neuroi, a fantastic introductory sequence describing the ""history"" of the world and culminating in a typical battle with the ""counterattack"" theme soaring in the background... This is Strike Witches. 
 
Well, all right, that's not the be-all and end-all of the show. Strike Witches is a ""mecha-musume"" show, sure, but it's mainly a fantasy character drama loosely based on 20th century history. Yoshika Miyafuji reprises her role as a young woman from Yokosuka called upon to save Europe, but there's this teensy little problem: she lost her Witch powers. 
 
I kinda like the solution the production came up with: Shizuka, a straight-laced, by-the-book ""soldier"" Witch who knows the military regs backwards and forwards, and of course idolizes Yoshika, thinking she's this soldier hero. I suppose the New Girl (TM) here is an archetype of the ""history nerds"" in the audience. Like the other two ""proper"" soldiers in season 1 (Perinne and Gertrud), Shizuka is dismayed when Yoshika repeatedly and incorrigibly flaunts military protocol, and because of the idol worship angle, she is understandably crushed when Yoshika defies a direct order from a commanding officer. It's a simple conflict, it's been done before, but it was done very well and really rounded out Shizuka as a foil to Yoshika. 
 
Meanwhile, the European Witches (plus Charlotte), while scattered throughout different airbases, have been busy. There's a new Neuroi on the loose, and not only is it one helluva dogfighter, it seems to slip past reconnaisance patrols. While still not as interesting as the Neuroi ""Witch"" from season 1, I thought that it was a good way to show how far the 501st have come as a family of sorts and as a fighting force. At the same time, I thought the new Neuroi superpower was a clever one; World War II was a time when militaries rapidly advanced and depended upon technology, and what better way to throw a wrench into a mechanized army than to jam their radios? 
 
There's one bone I do have to pick with the show, and that's Eila and Sanya's scene. At first I thought it was a cute little interlude involving the two Witches that tended to be background characters from the beginning. A few years later and having watched Brave Witches, I now realize that the primary reason for that scene was to introduce the 502nd JFW visually and set the stage for their spinoff series. I think Eila/Sanya could've been better utilized here (I've never seen/heard a particularly good reason for moving them to the 502nd temporarily, they weren't involved in the major battle of that theater), and it made the impression upon me that the 502nd rides the 501st's coattails rather than standing upon their own strengths. I realize that's not entirely fair-- if the actresses of Brave Witches were cast at that point and each of them had a speaking line, it would've made the spinoff a bit more approachable for me; however, I doubt that anyone other than Nipa and Sasha were cast when the film's dialogue was recorded-- that panning shot of (most of) the rest of the 502nd was probably a polished character design sketch at this point. I don't know, that scene felt like the entire Brave Witches series: so much potential, and yet an opportunity missed. 
 
The way Yoshika was brought back to the 501st is sappy, overly dramatic, predictably cliche, and yet oddly satisfying-- any fan of the series would've wanted her back in the sky even if it meant breaking a few laws of physics and norms of reality. The reason Mio gave probably should've been sent back for a rewrite, though. The final fight scene is solely to set up the 501st flying in formation to the tune of their fanfare music. 
 
Other highlights and wrap up: 
- A decent nod to the real Battle of the Bulge; I thought tossing in General Eisenhower was a cool touch. Too bad MacArthur, Halsey, or Yamamoto will likely never be seen in this franchise. Patton might make an appearance if they keep this up. Montgomery... who cares, he's a jerk. 
- As always, a solid character drama, though it did feel like a really long episode of the TV show rather than a proper motion picture. 
- Perinne has to be the best-developed character by the time of the film. In the beginning she was one-dimensional yuri fodder, always picking fights with Yoshika-- it was, frankly, a waste of Miyukichi's talents. In the film her character has embraced everything that infuriated her in the TV series, down to the medicinal herbs she was disappointed to find; instead of someone desperately trying to find peace around her, she has realized peace within herself. In the end, she's still a Mio fangirl, so that's funny too. 
- The soundtrack got an orchestral makeover (like Girls und Panzer a couple of years later). The new tracks are... all right. The memorable tracks from the TV show are positioned perfectly.

    When i started to watch the movie i just had finished the main series and thought they were good it just had it's bad's too.  
For me this series got better and better to the end and this movie was very good finish because i think that to this anime the smaller length suits very well because i doesn't give enough time to do the to my opinion ""pointless"" fan service, so it can focus on the story. 
And i'm kinda sucker for the fact that someone loses his/her powers and resurrects again at one point =) 
At the end the whole series was good and this movie was very good finish to overall good series that when i begun thought that ""this isn't going to be very good"".

    There is something about Strike Witches, despite all it's cheesiness, the mediocre plot, and the panty shots that leaves you fulfilled and always wishing for more. And just like the past seasons from before, the movie of the series delivers a fun ride with a conclusion that just leaves you warm and fuzzy in the end. 
 
There isn't much to say about plot as it follows expectations you would have a movie adaptation, and it follows the typical Strike Witches formula. The Neuroi invade Europe, they catch the protagonists and army by surprise, and it's up to the 501st to reunite and save the day. Sounds familiar? It should sound, as it is the basic conceptual story followed by the past two seasons. A basic problem of the movie's plot is that it offers almost no new information to the storyline; whether it comes to the Neuroi's mysterious presence, Yoshika's father, the plans of the world leaders, etc.  Those looking for something new and refreshing will be disappointed; those that want to re-experience the magic of a past enjoyment will get what they want.  
 
The character development that focuses on Miyafujii stays much the same; her typical good character and willingness to help others. It is again the same thing you saw before in the anime, offering nothing new or really innovative. The new addition Hattori Shizuka is focused on as well, but sadly she is regulated to a simple character archetype and does not offer much in the character department. The only real enjoyment of the characters in this movie is seeing the other Strike Witches again, and the many cameos that appear from other Strike Witches doujins, light novels, and mangas. This is good fanservice in a sense, but to fully enjoy it the viewer has to have experienced and delved into the other works, which probably will not hold true for most people who have only gone through the anime.  
 
When it comes to the battles, Strike Witches has always been good with the eye-porn of the massive gun fights, lasers, going through enemy fire, and of course the panty shots. The animation during the movie's fights are superb and it makes really hard for someone to take their eyes away once the glorious air fights begin. There is beauty in seeing the Witches charge their way to the Neuroi, all the while giving you glimpses of those underskirts. 
 
In the end, Strike Witches The Movie is something made for the fans. It doesn't offer anything new to the brand or takes the one step forward to beyond. It follows the past formulas it has used; and in that sense it may objectively be said to be mediocre and taking advantage of a cash cow. Still, it gives the fans the enjoyable experience that have had in the anime, and there is no reason for someone who enjoyed the past two seasons to skip out on the movie.

    If it's not obvious from my rating, I'm a huge Strike Witches fan.  I originally found the series randomly on Hulu and eventually I watched all of it, besides the one non- victory ova that I didn't know existed until a few weeks ago, in like 4 days.  I love this anime a lot because it's very true to what it is and the movie is the same way.  You get a bunch of cute girls with familiars that can use magic to perform moves and fly, and they also don't wear pants, which I've read is because striker units need almost direct skin contact to access the magical energy so they can start the propellers that allow the witches to fly.   
 
Strike Witches the movie gives you a chance to see all the old characters, the fun interactions that you want to see again, a new type of neuroi, and a new girl who was sent to get Yoshika and take her to a top medical school where she can do study abroad.  The new neuroi causes lots of havoc which is expected and it's nice to see a new kind instead a recycled old type of neuroi.  I don't always like when shows pull this stuff, but Strike Witches is the very definition of friendship is power.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend watching it.  Expect what the series offers you and nothing more.  Hope you enjoy it too! 
 
I feel like adding one more thing to my review. This movie also keeps the character driven aspect of the series.  Considering most of the mains series was episodic, being character driven is important to  keep things interesting.   You won't be disappointed by this aspect in the movie either.

    The quality of a movie, television series, or book is always proportional to the quality of its characters.  Regardless of your feelings on Strike Witches, the same rule applies here.  I don’t make it a secret that I’m a monster fan; bias is inevitable.  However, let me at least let give you a small glimpse of Strike Witches through my eyes, and if I’ve changed even just one person’s opinion, I’ve succeeded in this review. 
 
Hitting on that first note about characters, what I liked most about the movie were the contrasting differences between the two main Witches.  While Yoshika easily takes the spotlight by being more capable (and by capable, I mean badass) than she ever was, this movie is just as much about Shizuka, who strives to be like Major Sakamoto: strict, disciplined, and always lives by regulations.  It’s only natural; Hattori comes from a family with a strong military background.  However, every single time Shizuka tries to do things her way, Yoshika takes over and shows her something she’s not familiar with.  Something regulations don’t teach. 
 
If you asked me what Yoshika’s best quality is, it’s that she makes everyone around her better.  She’s been doing that since the beginning, and she continues to do it in her latest adventure as Shizuka herself becomes a better Witch by the time the credits roll. 
 
Now, there is a point in the movie that has some people feeling unfulfilled; those who have problems with how the movie turned out - and who actually need an ""explanation"" as to what happened with Yoshika - really need to understand the relationship between her and Shizuka. 
 
While all of the Witches were awesome in their own right in the movie, I'd like to give a special shout out to Perrine, who was better than ever.  Seeing her explaining to Shizuka about why Yoshika does what she does...really hit me hard.  In a good way, of course.  Looking back to when Perrine used to give our leading lady a hard time when she first became a Strike Witch, and then to see her express genuine feelings in that scene alone was simply amazing. 
 
I certainly can't write a Strike Witches review without mentioning the fanservice, can I?  Well, there really isn't anything we see in the movie that we haven't seen in the first two seasons.  If you've seen them, then you'll know what to expect.  If you want my personal opinion, I'm not against the fanservice, I would rather just like to see it toned down a bit in the future, if it can be helped. 
 
Something that I think everyone here would have enjoyed seeing more of would be Yoshika's and Shizuka's mini-adventures through Europe.  While the visuals weren't necessarily breathtaking, they weren't just ""there"" either.  Seeing some of the vineyards of Gallia was a refreshing view, and really helped bring a sense of detail to the movie. 
 
If there was anything I didn't like about the movie, it would be the lack of time given to the non-501st Witches.  For example, Nipa gives us a quick reference to her pilot archetype (Nils Katajainen), talks briefly with Eila, and that's about it.  Then there's Heidi, who seemed like she was just there to be moé up until a critical point in the film.  I understand there's a plot that has to be paid attention to, but going back to the very beginning regarding characters, it's equally important that the movie does all of the Witches justice, not just the 501st Joint Fighter Wing. 
 
Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and - as you can see from my score above - give it a 9 out of 10.  The film stayed true to the franchise, and to the delight of fans like myself, has opened the door for more Strike Witches anime.  Remember everyone… 
 
…there’s nothing a Witch can’t do!

    Strike Witches the Movie is a refreshing and fitting sequel to the two television series. Those who are not familiar with the Strike Witches franchise receive a brief introduction to the premise of the series, but they may not be able to appreciate the unique personalities of each character fully if they have not watched the preceding works.  
 
Strike Witches revolutionized the ""mecha musume"" genre of moe anthropomorphism, especially because of the special attention given to the realistic setting of the series. Compared to the futuristic setting of Shimada Humikane's earlier work Sky Girls, Strike Witches employs World War II era technology and personalities as the basis of its story. In a timeline where Earth's history is altered because of the invasion of unknown aliens, the total war we know of is re-imagined as a fight between modern witches and the mysterious alien Neuroi. 
 
Following the conclusion of Strike Witches 2, speculation was ripe among fans as to how the story could continue because the series protagonist Miyafuji Yoshika seemed to have lost the major driving force of her character development. It soon became evident that the creators did not intend on taking Miyafuji out of the picture. Strike Witches the Movie opens in August 1945, and the calm that follows the liberation of Venezia (Venice) and Romagna (Italy) mirrors the real world scenario where World War II is nearing its conclusion. Unfortunately for the witches, the Neuroi still remain a formidable enemy, and signs of a new invasion soon begin to appear throughout Europe. In the meantime, Miyafuji travels from her home in the Fuso Empire (Japan) to Helvetia (Switzerland) in order to enroll in a medical school and fulfill her desire to become a doctor. 
 
Viewers are introduced to a new protagonist to the franchise. Hattori Shizuka, a newly minted officer with the Fuso Empire who enters the military with the same enthusiasm as Miyafuji did in early 1944. For Hattori, Miyafuji is the hero of the Fuso Empire who is admired throughout the country, yet Miyafuji does not seem to care for the hierarchical structure and formalities of the military and instead willingly takes up work seemingly unrelated to the fight against the Neuroi. This contradiction presents a conflict for the naïve Hattori, who dreams of the glory of battle described in stories of Miyafuji. In this way, it appears as if Hattori was introduced in order to serve as a foil to Miyafuji; however, viewers soon realize that her stubbornness mirrors that of Miyafuji's when the latter first entered the military and sought to find her own purpose in the war. 
 
Characters from the earlier television series, especially members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, return in numerous cameo appearances throughout the movie, guiding Miyafuji and ensuring her safety in the land journey from Gallia (France) to Helvetia. Viewers are also treated with additional appearances of witches in other units throughout Europe who are called into action by the new Neuroi enemy that caught them off guard. While it initially seems as if there are two separate plots in the movie, viewers are reminded that Miyafuji is indeed the main protagonist as the story begins to converge around her. 
 
Strike Witches is known for its impressive mechanical design. Following in the footsteps of the two television series, the movie features World War II military hardware in detail, including the Japanese aircraft carrier Amagi. AIC presents an artistic quality that is above average, and the animation is especially entertaining to watch during aerial combat scenes. Despite the prevalence of low camera angles intended to market its military-girls-in-underwear appeal, these shots are weaved quite well into the combat animation, making them less distracting. If there were any complaints about the art itself, perhaps it is that the theatrical poster does not do enough justice to the quality of the movie. 
 
The soundtrack of the movie does not vary from the television series, and viewers can immediately recognize the trumpet fanfare that has become the signature piece of theme music from Strike Witches. While this can become a point of concern, it can also present the viewer with the an atmosphere that unifies the movie with the two television series. Voice acting of returning characters also does not vary in the movie, but the performance of Uchida Aya as Hattori Shizuka is well deserving of an applause as she captured Hattori's transformation into a character who begins to understand Miyafuji's ideals. This is followed by a special ending song which features Hattori's voice actress in its vocal cast. 
 
If the viewer enjoyed the two television series, they will find the movie even more enjoyable. On the other hand, if the viewer feels that the franchise has become stale without recent developments, the movie can reinvigorate interest. Pacing of the plot is conducted in a balanced way by breaking it up into scenarios that resolve themselves quickly and maintain viewer interest as if discovering local adventures during a road trip through continental Europe.

    Kara no Kyoukai would have to be one of my all time favourites anime's of all time simply because I like the the detail to which the producers went. The story, at times, was a bit weak and a bit confusing, but on the whole I enjoyed Fukan Fuukei  a lot. The fight scenes during the movie were outstanding (probably the most colourful i've seen) and the music to go with the fight scenes hit the mark. The characters were human at most times but some times they seemed to lose themselves. Overall, I would have to say the Kara no Kyoukai series is one of my favourites and the movie truly was outstanding.

    NO SPOILERS 
 
(This review is for all the movies that compose Kara no Kyoukai) 
 
Story(7) According to me, the story of Kara no Kyoukai is too complicated, philosophical. Too many words are used to say something simple, these words scramble your mind uselessly. For example, I think I waste 30min of my time in the epilogue of this saga... However, there are some plot twists which are enjoyable. 
 
Art(9) The movies didn't grew old! The drawings and particularly the animation of ufotable are joyous. The settings are very beautiful too. The 4:3 format also makes me nostalgic. It's surely the point to justify the fact that it's an anime I recommend. 
 
Sound(9) The overture and the action theme are really pleasant to hear, the music of Yuji Kajiura fill its role wonderfully, accentuating the actions and the replies. Like the art, nothing to say.   
 
Character(8) The characters are well developed, we can see their evolution. Nevertheless, I have the impression that they are too neutral, motionless. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall(8) Too complicated and philosophical for me, Kara no Kyoukai stay nonetheless a good experience. I didn't enjoy very much the development of the story but I think, with these movies, it's ""I love or I hate"". Kara no Kyoukai isn't balanced: some movies are such more interesting than others... I recommend it despite all these things

    Being the first installment in the critically acclaimed Kara no Kyoukai, means any regular person watches it expecting surreal and vivid plot and suspense, where things aren't always what they seem. Instead we are greeted with a borefest which thankfully lasts only 50 minutes, otherwise I would have quit halfway.  
 
Character 
Character development is non-existent and the archetypes mostly bland. If I had to sum it up: You can't solve a puzzle without its pieces. We know next to nothing about the characters' life, beliefs, motivations and most importantly how they ended up in the present situation, which lends itself to their mysterious personas. However, you feel no real belief or strong emotions from our bland protagonist which leaves you wondering what is her purpose in life. We don't feel any empathy or connection to any of our protagonists which removes any sort of tension the movie could have and leaves you apathetic and uncaring towards their struggles (if you can call them that). How can you solve a puzzle without its pieces? How can you learn about the character if the movie doesn't develop them? 
 
Story 
I saw a review which stated the movies are in random order and that this is a good thing because it is how the series is meant to be watched. Well, I can say that they could have made one less movie, because you gain nothing by watching this. I could literally skip this movie and watch the second and lose absolutely nothing by it. Nothing is revealed throughout the movie so you stop watching it with a bitter feeling in your mouth. It's incomplete, there's no satisfaction because there's no development to the overarching plot. There's no difference in the beginning and the end. No character development, no change in circumstances (they return to life as it used to be) no enemies or friends made just...nothing. NOTHING HAPPENS!!!! EVERYTHING'S THE SAME!!!! 
 
Art 
Stunning at times but the faces are really bland. and fight choreography is woefully mediocre. 
 
Sound 
I found it very good with beautiful ost, the best part of the movie certainly. 
 
Which leads me to one major gripe that I have is with one scene in particular. The fight scene. It has beautiful animation (like stunning) and amazing soundtrack, but when I watched all I could think was"" what a waste"". 
There were two glaring issues: one was the lack of any tension whatsoever (even with the art and sound which says a lot about the movie), as I said you don't care about the characters at all which helps, but adding to that you never once doubt the outcome, its pretty obvious the protagonist will win. But other than that its the way in which she wins, its a massacre. None of the opponents put up any sort of fight besides the ""last boss"" which yells once (it has no effect) and then dies. Truly a waste of very good art and brilliant sound. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall - 3 
Skip this movie, you gain nothing from it. Inflated ratings mainly due to future installments (I hope). 
 
Sidenote - pretty complex abstract ideas and philosophies that certainly require thought to interpret it, but I bet most won't even pay attention because the subtitles go so fast you need to either be engaged (which you won't be) and instantly understand or pause to read. A nice touch but they mostly aren't realistic (as in I personally don't think more than a handful of people would have those trains of thought). Lol don't know why I even bothered to review such a shit movie, no one's gonna read this anyway.

    I have not read the manga therefore I will be reviewing this movie strictly from anime perspective as someone who has only seen the first part of the Kara no Kyoukai story as if it was a completely individual production. 
 
The general impression I have after watching this anime is that the great animation tries to make up for the relatively poor storyline. 
 
Regarding the story, before watching the movie I was hoping for something more than a typical there are suicides and a ghost cliche. What I was looking for was some moral or philosophical truth which I could understand only after watching the full movie and putting all the pieces together as if it was a jigsaw. 
 
Unfortunately, although that slight amount of moral thought is present throughout the movie, after the very first coversation between two of main chracters it becomes so straight forward that the next twenty, or so, minutes of the movie should be cut down to no more than five, since they do not stimulate one's mind to think even in the slightest. 
 
The greater picture of the movie and the message it was suppose to sent was literally served to me on a plate half way through, therefor causing the movie to be an inengaing yawner for at least one third of it. 
 
That's pretty much it about the greater picture, which is dissapointing becuase the way it is being shown ruins a pretty damn good idea. 
 
When it comes to the suicides on which the story was supposed to develop I had a feeling that I have seen all of it before. But still it could have been quite intriguing if the suicide story want in pair with the developments of the moral background of the movie. This practically does not occur, the moral aspects to why is everything happening seem to develop in a very loose relation to the suicides and entity related to it. 
 
I did not expect to see a state of art story, yet this movie, did not use the potential it had even in the slightly, leaving me with a generally avarage, barely engaging story. 
 
Another thing that actually I couldn't connect with were the characters. In the movie we actually have three that play any part in the story. That would be Touko, Shiki and the menace responsibile for the suicides. 
 
Individually the characters don't seem too bad. Tokuo is especially intriguing, it is evident that she hold a few secrets, which will be revealed later on in the following movies. The 'ghost' is somehow typical but somehow I really felt sorry for what it had been through. Shiki is a different pair of boots, like to story she has potential, which is simply not used properly, let's hope that is the case only of the first movie. 
 
Shiki has powers, of which originins we have no clue. She seems to be deeply frustrated by something, possibly from her past, but once again we have no clue what it is. You can actually call her a big question mark with ass-kicking abbilities. I don't find this method of character development appealing at all. Instead of being shown a billion question at the same time and not providing any answers, I'd rather get a few in the begining, have some of them asnwered and then receive a new bunch. Here, I barely got a single answered about Shiki, therefore in my eyes she did not develop as I have expected and due to this state of things I could not establish a connection with the character. 
 
If we look at our the 'mystery solving' as one we get quite a good picture. They seem to complete each other in their tasks, they have easily distinguishable personalities. However what bothers me is the fact that the primary question why did they get involved in the fight with the supernatural is not answered. You need some sort of reason to do that, it's not like you wake up one day and an idea to kick some etheral ass pops into your head. 
 
When it comes to sound the movie is good. The voice acting does not have too much work to do, since some characters are underdeveloped, but it is still handeled in a pretty decent fashion. 
 
The music is good yet akward. In some moments it's genius while in other not even noticeable. It also suffers from the fact that it does not build up steadily. Some themes are gentle and mysterious while other are action packed and emotional. The problem is that there is nothing between the two and it may give the impression that two seperate soundtracks were written for the movie. 
 
Without doubt, animation is the best aspect of this production. The character animation is good, not too good though. But the enviroment, especially that of the Fujyou building is amazing. The suicides scenes are also a masterpiece. However, sometimes I had the strange feeling that the computer generated animation was running visibly smoother than the drawn one, but that did not ruin the general impression which was great. 
 
Without any regret I have to admit that the movie suffered from the fact that the story was simply not told in an intriguing and intresting fashion and rather poor character development. It is a beautiful picture, but an average story. If it was not for the genius animation this movie would not exceed avarage. 
 
However, it was still worth to watch it till the very end and see the trailer of the second Kara no Kyoukai movie, which hopefully will answer all the questions asked in this one. 
 
Still, even on its own, this movie is worth watching because of the stunning animation.

    Seven movies between fifty minutes and two hours and a half long, Kara no Kyoukai presents itself as an oddity from the beginning. Yet, it still manages to be surprising. 
 
Art/sound : 
I usually don't like to separate my reviews by category, but with how the first movie (and the other ones actually) presents itself, I thik it's actually pretty legit in this case. 
The movie starts with shots of a girl on a roof accompanied by a soft music. And this first scene alone encapsulates the appeal of the first movie : everything is scary and unsettling, yet you are drawn by its beauty. Be it Ufotable's work on lighting, or Kajiura's compositions, everything keeps feeling strange, yet... incredibly beautiful.  
 
Character/Story :  
And then, suddenly, it cuts to a dialogue between our two main characters Shiki and Mikiya, and you feel that this is, indeed, a work of the master Nasu. You may know him for the Fate series, and if you do, you will know how this movie will turn out : a fairly interesting story driven by its incredible characters and their dynamic. As usual, you can feel that while every character is interesting on its own, it's really when they interact with each other that they shine.    
But what sets Nasu's works apart from the rest (except maybe from Taro's latest works) is that strange optimistic passion that drives the main characters in an otherwise nihilistic world. unfortunately, I can't explain it without going into spoilers, but know that it is the main thing that sets this anime apart from all the edgy bullshit they serve you once in a while.   
 
In the end, Kara no Kyoukai 1 offers an ""overlooking view"" at what makes the serie as a whole a masterpiece : complex and interesting characters, an unsettling atmosphere that you can't help but be drawn in, and a strange sense of optimism in a dark and depressing world. If you enjoyed that movie, I can guarantee that you will enjoy the Kara no Kyoukai serie as a whole.

    No spoiler. 
 
To depict a horrific/thriller atmosphere, the anime is set in a greenish desaturated environment. It’s like looking through fog or pollution: it’s boring. 
 
I liked the intro scene. It is clever at introducing the main character but then it’s your typical storytelling: look-how-contemplative-and-deep-I-am. Unfortunately the scenario is empty as the main character’s appartment ;) Characters are so blasé that you can’t connect with the unoriginal story drama. Soundtrack is nice. 
 
Avoid if you're suicidal <- joke 
 
That being said, I know it's the first chapter of seven, so the rest may have the overall story fuller. Though, I clearly lack the motivation to try the second part. 
 
 
This review got me a bit of hate. It's ok if you strongly disagree with me. Be nice to people.

    This film seems to start in a way which deprives you of information, only to gain them overtime, but still leaves you questioning after the film is over. 
I would say that the main part of this film's story is about introducing you, the audience, to the main character alongside with the settings/scenarios in the main character's world. And it does it's job at that while providing a decent fixed story line for us to enjoy. 
I would personally say this as a prologue to the upcoming films, since it only provides general/simple information about the world's setting and the characters, and does not go into deep details about them. 
At the end of the film, one would have a general idea but still have questions, which isn't a bad thing personally since it can encourage one to continue looking through the other films. (As smart anime characters always used to say ""Human are curious creatures"") 
 
I am personally not picky about Art/Sound. But I have to mention that the art was exceptionally well made in the sense that it gave off a lot of details. The music portrayed suited the scenarios extremely well too. 
 
This film gives you just enough information about a character, slightly less if not. But as mentioned previously, it does not go too deep into detail about a character's story line. 
Though not a lot, the character's personality and details showcased was all relevant towards the film's story and made it enjoyable too. 
 
Personally, I enjoyed watching this film. The one noticeable letdown to me was the long unnecessarily pauses that some scenes have, which can often be misleading/confusing.

    Don't despair, this is spoiler free ;) 
Let me take a guess here. You have minimal knowledge of it's source material (Kara no Kyoukai Novel), prequel material (Tsukihime) and it's world (Nasuverse) apart from it being supposedly at the same setting as the Fate series with the same writer (Nasu). Chances are you just finished Fate/Zero and was yearning from something like it, people pointed you in this direction (Kara no Kyoukai) and you were on the verge of diving in like a madman plunging yourself in a story made of concrete that - by the way - you're wholly ignorant of but in the last minute managed to stop yourself out of hesitation so here you are, reading a review to convince your hesitant mind on whether to push or pull. Ignorant and insane but wary.. I like that. Fear not for we are brothers! I'm in the same boat as you. :3 
Do note that I am reviewing this with no prior knowledge of the series, it's source material, world and prequel novel as I've stated above. I am also going in on this as a standalone episode, going through the next movies with the previous ones in mind and vice-versa so the existence of it's next movies doesn't really affect my opinion of this specific one. 
 
Story - 5/10 
Makes as much sense to me as why I was even born in this world. Yep, guessed it. That means zero (yes as a matter of fact I'm a guy who's wallowing in self-despair) sense. Though at this point in time, my ignorance prevents me from actually understanding what the nuts is up with this revered 'masterpiece' I think that the ambiguity behind the story to us plebeians reverberates some feeling of interest and thrill. Seems like there's actually some merit to it, as I've noticed that I was more attentive to detail and dialogue than I normally am - a result of trying to 'crack the code'. It might not have much of a story but the beauty is in digesting what you see as if you were a newborn chick so in that light, it's still entertaining even if you just don't know what the YOLK(tm) is going on. It's a mystery but from what I see it does seem to drop some hints for what's to come. 
 
Art - 8/10 
The visuals are great, eyecandy enough to call it splendid. Why just eight though? It might be that my standards are just high but I'm mainly attributing it to the fact that it's a movie. If this was a series then it'd be a ten but more time was spent on the production of this (and I guess more budget too) so I'm not really convinced that this is the best that they could've done. Then again, that might be just me. 
 
Sound - 6/10 
Yeah.. this is looking pretty subjective and I'm not trying to hide that. I was pretty disappointed because Yuki Kajiura is my favorite composer. It's a six because it is certainly slightly average and does accomplish the specific ambiance that both the composer and the directors were going for but it ends there. It's nothing more than achieving the goal - not trying to go beyond it. 
 
Character - 5/10 
The ensemble is nteresting enough to be quite entertaining to watch and decipher. I can't say much. I think that it's enough to be 'average', not good to upscale the balance but not bad to drag it down either. They're okay though they do seem to be of much depth, but that's really just a guess. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall Score - 6/10 
It's cool, pretty relaxing to watch actually. Entertaining enough and nothing mindblowing but the ambiguity (to me) it has going for it scales the movie up a bit due to the previously stated fat that it tends to make me focus more in an attempt to decipher the great puzzle beholding my eyes so I settled with six.

    Kara no Kyokai has taken up the third spot in my list of 10 out of 10 rated animes. This anime has everything you could want. A interesting story, complex characters, and absolutely outstanding animation. The show follows a man named Kokuto as he gets closer to the mysterious Shiki Ryougi. a girl with the ability to see the flaws in all of creation, and thus destroy them. Shiki is one of the most complex and interesting characters I've ever seen and I highly recommend that you give this show a watch. The format is a little odd, seven movies instead of twenty episodes, and it's all told out of order. this can be a little confusing.

    To top things off, I first realized this movie from the ""Top Anime"" list where the 5th movie was rated #1. Unfortunately, I was unable to watch the 5th movie to start off with since I didn't want to be awkwardly confused about what has happened. So I decided to check out all the Kara No Kyoukai movies. 
 
This movie was quite unique compared to the other anime I watch. Be it that there is actually FOR ONCE a strong female character in this movie. The male protagonist wasn't too girly either which gave me confidence to continue the movie. Anyways, the drawing of this movie was well done and the makers did not cut-out any of the gore, which interested me even more because this is something that could in real life.  
 
I found the entire supernatural thing kind of off, but most anime has to have some sort of unique power to make a great storyline. Moreover, the story is very vague in the beginning, which gives the watcher a sense of confusion and the usual: ""What the heck is going on...""  
 
Thus I give this movie an overall rating of a 9.

    This movie is based on a light novel by Nasu Kinonko, a writer for TYPE-MOON that brought us Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime. Before watching this movie, I've read some chapters on baka-tsuki and I find the novel confusing so I decided to read other novels from that site so in other words I watched this movie with only little knowledge but what the heck?? This show is awesome!!! Good thing I saw the torrent link in animesuki and I immediately downloaded it. 
 
What really caught my attention in the movie was the outstanding visuals. The studio ufotable was able to make KyoAni's animation look like Gonzo. It's evident that the studio was given big budget and I think they used it very well. The water effects and camera angle are so awesome that it's breathtaking. The character designs was lovely and I'm in love with a new Tsundere Ryougi Shiki. The movie is quite bloody but I think most people could tolerate it. The bloody scenes are only for just a few moments. I don't find it that gory mainly because I enjoy watching this kinds of things 
 
The voice acting was also superb especially how Maaya Sakamoto voiced an apathetic, male sounding voice of Shiki. I really find her VA appropriate for Shiki, it fits her character. 
 
The story was at first confusing for me because I don't really know the story. There are so many questions in my head like when did Shiki got those eyes, what happen to her, is Kokuto her love interest etc. but good thing this is a movie series so I hope the sequels will clear everything up. This movie also touches up some philosophical things about life and there are also some inspiring quotes. I like the quotes about suicide and flying vs floating. Your thoughts will get provoked by this movie, I promise you, it will left you wondering during bedtime.  
 
The character I liked in the movie was Shiki alone because the other characters are just so-so. I like this girl, she's strong and tough and to boot that up she's also pretty and if ever she became a boy I think she's handsome. This movie is full of moe moments like the 90 seconds ice cream(Haagen Daaz) eating and the pouting Shiki at the near end.  
 
The music/sounds was also appropriate with each scenes. The story is has an eerie athmosphere and the bgm gives more emphasis on that. During action scenes the bgm was pumped up and if it's just conversations it's slow but the mystery-eerie feelings are still there. 
 
All in all this is the best anime movie I've watched so far. It has pretty visuals, awesome female lead and an interesting story that makes you crave for more. This movie is quite serious and it requires your concentration so you shouldn't watch it with tired minds. I really love the movie and I'm excited on the sequel because we get to see the background of Shiki and Kokuto. 
 
The next movie is entitled Kara no Kyoukai : Murder Study (Part 1) and I've watched it already and it's also awesome. I don't know when will I be reviewing that together with the 3rd movie but I hope that I won't be possessed by the spirit of laziness so that I can make a review.

    i watched this in my anime club last week, and i thought it was really good! 
of course, the only reason i dnt find it astounding is because when i watched it it wuz in really bad quality and a lot of the dialogue was missed because of that, so i will be sure to rewatch it. 
i wouldnt call this ""thrilling"" but i think ""beautiful"" would fit this perfectly. the art wuz amazing and the story wuz explained well and wuz put together excellently. the only part i did not find to be the best wuz the characters, they all seemed very flat. not horrible, just flat. characters aside, this iz a great movie and iz highly recommended

    This movie really reminded how much I love these kinds of animes rather than just pure shonen. I have to say that the soundtrack is magnificently done; the music really gets you into the atmosphere during the whole movie. The animation is brilliant as hel as well! As for the story, it's somewhat confusing but very philosophical? Nothing wrong with that in my opinion. A very great movie.

    I love this anime, this is one of my favorite. The protagonists of this story do not really match up, because the girl protagonists is cold and known as a murderer and the boy protagonist is kind, gentle and really nice. But with the mix of reality to fantasy, it really strike me deeply, seeing how they mix up with each other, how things work out. Kara no Kyoukai is one of the best anime movie i've ever seen. Perfect for me!

    Following the intuitions of ""Fate / Stay Night"", Kara no Kyoukai film serie is basically a post-modernist cocktail of modern anime stereotypes: partly a school comedy/drama, partly adventure & magic show and partly psychological thriller. This is a elaborate, but unstable construction - many ingredients, but too many of them (magic elements are good example) function like a weak links. When show is more chamber-like, portraying the psychological tension between characters it can be very successful,  but also too often falls in pathetic tone and self-indulgence. Lets say it: Kara no Kyoukai tries to be more than it is. Plot is rather episodic and trivial and negative characters (there was really a need to put enemies in?) uninspired. Sometimes anime takes the form of serial killer thriller, which isn't a bad thing, but using Matrix-like fight style and extreme, gore violence (a' la Elfen Lied) maybe wasn't necessary. Of course there are positives - whole protagonists cast is adorable, especially main heroine Ryougi Shiki), balancing between her alter-egos (male and female), sense of predator and growing human feelings - probably one of the most interesting female anime characters ever. Art and animation is gorgeous, as well as music. But what makes this show worth watching is unmatched, morbid, gothic-like and romantic atmosphere which additionally gives the suspense to most tragic/terrible visions.  
 
First (but chronologically speaking rather five) implementation maybe isn't best introduction to this infernal show - it's rather simple and trivial ""ghost story"" (a' la Mushishi) but slow-pacing narration holds in tense and mix of urban / magic visions is already present.

    Note: This review covers movies 1-7 
 
Kara no Kyoukai aka The Garden of Sinners is dark and beautiful and philosophical and filled with intensity. This was the anime that made studio ufotable worth something. Prior to 2007 and The Garden of Sinners, the studio had not really done anything too notable. The studio was founded by former TMS Entertainment staff (Lupin the Third, Detective Conan), and interestingly enough Kara no Kyoukai was written by Kinoko Nasu and published by Type-Moon. Basically, The Garden of Sinners was the blue print for the Fate/Stay series and other popular Type-Moon productions. 
 
The Garden of Sinners main plot takes course over seven movies. Our story takes place in Mifune City following the character Shiki Ryogi. These movies do not take place in chronological order. Each of the seven movies which in total amounts to about a 25 episode show are watched like a mystery novel where the viewer’s job is to put the pieces of the puzzle together. This puzzle consists of everything from combining the separate stories into one coherent story to stringing together character development for their actions and moods to make any sense. It really is an interesting and unique take to tell a story compared to any anime prior. Some would easily be put off by not watching the show in chronological order, but the point to the movies are to build up an extraordinary amount of suspense fitting for a mystery. 
 
Shiki possesses what is called the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. It is a powerful ability in which allows Shiki to see the death of all things. The plot focuses around her working at an agency that investigates “disturbing events.” There is the boss of the agency who is a mage known as Touko Aozaki, and there is Shiki’s friend who somehow finds his way into the agency as well called Mikiya Kokutou. The extra little interesting information is Shiki has dual personalities; one male and one female. Female Shiki is a bit shy and very unsociable while the male personality is outgoing and extremely violent. This disorder Shiki has creates complicated feelings, conversations, and interactions with Mikiya. Where the story has the interesting mystery sub-plot events the agency solves, there is the on-going main-plot of a string of murders where the male Shiki is involved leading up to an accident where Shiki ends up in a coma. That particular mystery is always present and thought about. 
 
The Garden of Sinners does have a slow start, long expositions of philosophical mind-bending questions, and inconsistent pacing. Animation is brilliant. It immediately attracts the viewer while the philosophy and high amount of symbolism keeps the mind working. Type-Moon knew how engage the audience with this grim, dark, and gritty mystery. No subject in human morals is missed throughout the seven movie journey from drug use, rape, suicide, and of course murder. Of course, have back to the animation and action. It might be one of the best visual experience for a human’s eyeballs. The atmosphere is filled with dark emotion yet maintains it despite a colourful mixture of deep purples, wild oranges and reds, blues from moonlight reflection, and an interesting use of turquois around characters to almost emit their personality. Plus, the choreography of action with music from Yuki Kajiura is among the best in anime seen at this point in time. 
 
However, where the series faults hard is what makes Kara no Kyoukai so interesting and that is the storytelling. This is pretty difficult to grasp with how complicated in can be while putting everything together over the course of seven movies. It is also very serious and pretty morbid most of the time making the viewer adapt to a certain dark mentality. Just from watching the first movie, it just throws the audience into the world and the characters without reason or backstory or development. It would not be unheard of for people to be irritated from that. Once more is the Type-Moon basic male character protagonist. In this case, Mikiya is boring, nonsensical, and overbearingly righteous. Plus, he has a little sister just pot-filled with too much energy. Mikiya is incredibly underwhelming and his actions really hurt the show and even Shiki both as a character and in the show. Mostly, Mikiya is there just to install emotions into Shiki with a proper build and emotional investment. 
 
Each movie is almost entirely self-contained with an interesting mystery to tell, but together with all the other movies, The Garden of Sinners is so much more. It is unique, brilliantly animated, amazing sound/music, atmospheric art, crazy-detailed backgrounds, and with unmatched lighting quality and effects it is a wonder how consistent the movies were with: 7 movies, all different directors, and 4 different animation directors! Just how?! Including just a wonderful ending to tie everything together, there is not too much to complain about. The Garden of Sinners is a wonderful ride that can now best be described for anime action fans as: an orgasm for your eyes, pure sensual intercourse for your ears, and multiple climaxes for your body.

    Kara no Kyoukai Fuukan Fuukei is an outstanding movie. It's colors are great, and sound + quality is amazing. I, in my opnion, think this movie should be awarded. It has a beautiful plot, and shows much feelings. Overall, it is the best! Atleast everyone should take a look or watch the movie.

    Yes, this film is one part of a much larger universe, the Nasuverse that includes both the Fate Series and Tsukihime, and as such should be considered with the rest of the franchise when rating. While this may not be the best starting point for an uninitiated, it does have several qualities that make it a good place to start consuming elements of the Nasuverse, namely the fact that it is a good stand alone film that doesn't rely too heavily on the deeper lore and backstory of the world. 
 
STORY/ENJOYMENT 
 
As a single film, disregarding it's connection to the Nasuverse, this film is a crime/mystery drama that treats the supernatural. The meat of the story is the mystery surrounding the apparent suicides of a number of young high school age girls, all from falling to their deaths from the room the of the same abandoned building. As such, the film builds up this mystery very well, building extra tension into the incident by having the it personally affect the main character Shiki, who was investigating it. The pacing of the story is the film's strong point, keeping you intrigued throughout the film as to the cause of the incidents. 
 
CHARACTER 
 
The characterization of the main characters is slight and, occurring mostly at the beginning and end of the film and, if I had to give the film a low score it would be here. But, there is enough to keep the story interesting and get you interested in the characters and lore surrounding them. Also, there is more characterization in the following films, so we can be forgiving of the lack of it here. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
It's crazy to think Ufotable hadn't done much before touching these films. Because of the Fate Series, Ufotable is now known as a powerhouse animation company that can accomplish a lot within it's budget. The animation in this film is not on the same level as later works like Fate/Zero or even other films in the Kara No Kyoukai series, but it is still incredible when compared to other films of the era. You will not be disappointed by the animation in this film. 
 
SOUND 
 
The score for the film is also great, adding tension to the murder-mystery, and longing to the deeper scenes of the film. Quiet when it needs to be, and intense when it needs to be. It's nothing revolutionary, but is interesting when looking at the perspective of how it acts as a precursor to later works in the Nasuverse. 
 
OVERALL 
 
With everything together, I would give this film a solid 7/10. It's an enjoyable film with a strong supernatural-mystery edge. If you enjoy other parts of the Nasuvere, or have a love for mystery, this film is for you. If you would like to get into films/shows in the Nasuverse, this isn't a bad place to start, as it doesn't rely too heavily on the lore of the world and is easy to follow.

    Well, since I am officially done with secondary school until my final year starts (And thank God for that as I’m sick of that damn place) I decided to rewatch a series of movies released by Ufotable before they got popular… and it’s another Nasu show. You know, I really hope that they finally animate Tsukihime once that remake comes out (Whenever it comes out) because they seem to be the only ones who can do these kinds of adaptations right. 
 
Either way, it’s Kara No Kyoukai. It’s often considered the predecessor of sorts to Tsukihime (In fact, up until Melty Blood came out, Shiki (Err… Tohno Shiki that is) and Mikiya had the Seiyuu) though it’s definitely different in many areas to say the least. 
 
This series of reviews will be a bit different from my usual reviews. They’re moreso going to be written in a retrospective-like fashion, with me moreso showing my overall thoughts on each of the movies instead of my usual method of reviewing stuff. They’re also gonna be filled to the brim with spoilers, so you have been warned. With that out of the way, let’s get into Kara No Kyoukai:  Fukan Fuukei (Borderline Of Emptiness: Overlooking View). 
 
This movie is not really set up as a standard first chapter in a story. Hell, timeline wise it’s set around the middle instead. Why they decided to do this (Aside from the fact that the original Light Novels were also set up this way) is not something I’m aware of, but if I had to guess, they put this one first as not much really happens that would affect the overall storyline… I think (I haven’t seen these movies in years so my memory is a bit faulty). 
 
Either way, from the way the characters talk alone, you can pretty much think “Yup, that’s Nasu”. Seriously, even with more experience this guy’s love of descriptions will never vanish, won’t it? They also tend to go on to spout philosophical blunder after philosophical blunder, with the big one being the whole “Fly or Float” thing near the end. This isn’t really an issue, mind you (It’s part of the reason Nasu’s style appeals to me), just something I wanted to point out. 
 
Either way, if there’s one thing this movie does right, is setting up a proper tone. The whole movie is set up with relatively dark colors, with the only colors that really stand out being the reds you’ll often see due to all the blood. There are other colors, however they seemed much more washed out in comparison. This might be because most on the movie is set in rooms with not much lighting, but the point remains. 
 
There’s also a general feeling of dread. There are more than a few scenes in which Shiki is just walking around and it’s just… unsettling to say the least. Not that that’s the only unsettling thing, what with all of the suicides going on. 
 
Let’s talk about our characters for a bit, shall we? Ryougi Shiki gets probably the most focus here. Having been rewatching some Fate stuff recently, she reminds me a lot of Saber: Stoic, graceful, badass and so on. That said, I think this woman has a few… issues. I mean, all Nasuverse MCs aren’t mentally stable (Emiya Shirou has no sense of self and doesn’t find joy in anything but helping people, Tohno Shiki is basically a sociopath who probably enjoys killing a bit more than he should and Aoko… actually Aoko’s pretty normal all things considered) but at least they try to act normal. Shiki doesn’t even bother with that; she’s either just plain stoic or plain sorta scary. 
 
On the other hand, we have Aozaki Touko. Yup, Aoko’s sister… which is kinda weird considering KnK doesn’t take place in the same universe as either Tsukihime or Mahou Tsukai No Yoru, but hey, it’s the Nasuverse. This kind of stuff is common. She seems to be the sorta mentor character going by this movie alone, helping out Shiki and Mikiya seems to work for her. I like her, but I haven’t seen enough of her to say more and my memory on these movies is a bit faulty. 
 
Finally it’s Kokutou Mikiya, the only normal man in the group and he’s in a coma for half the damn movie. He does seem like a legitimately nice guy though; however he doesn’t really do anything. I get it, he’s a non-combatant, but even so, he doesn’t get that much screen time. We do however get some slight insight into his psyche given some comments Touko makes of him, but that’s about it. 
 
Finally is our villain and the most developed character in this movie, Fujou Kirie. I’ve noticed there are two kinds of Nasuverse villains: The crazy ones or the sympathetic ones (And also some that are a combination of the two). Kirie is the definitely the sympathetic kind. She’s pretty much in constant suffering considering her condition, and aside from being a bit too jealous of Shiki, she seems like a decent enough woman. Rie Tanaka’s performance in the role is great, bringing a great deal of humanity to this character. While the conclusion to her story is tragic, ultimately it was also a fitting one. 
 
But let’s throw the damn drama aside. Because remember, this is the Nasuverse, there’s gonna be some weird supernatural stuff. And what do our heroes do when this happens? Beat the shit out of it! Yes, even before it became a meme to call out Ufotable for having so much money, they were still doing it, and it is glorious! The soundtrack is fantastic as well. If you’ve seen Fate/Zero, this soundtrack might seem a bit familiar, which isn’t that odd given how they were both composed by Yuki Kajiura. She might not be my favorite Nasuverse composer (That would be Hideyuki Fukasawa) but she is a damn close second. 
 
Finally, I wanna address the one thing that brings this movie down: NOTHING HAPPENS! Oh sure, stuff does happen, but for the overall plot? Nothing! It’s also a too slowed paced for my taste. Yeah, the beginnings to Nasu’s stories are always slow paced, but that doesn’t make it any better. 
Overall, Fukan Fuukei isn’t a perfect movie, but it’s not a bad movie either. It has the right amount of suspense to keep me engaged and enough action to get my blood boiling. It’s not perfect, but hey, I’ll take what I can get. 
 
Final Score: 7/10

    Scores out of 100. 35 for Story, 35 for Characters, 15 for Sound, and 15 for Animation 
 
Story (28/35) Good start to this series, with thought provoking dialogue but with few character details.  
 
Characters (24/35) Since we know so little of the characters, it is hard to give them good scores. The antagonist in this movie is pretty good.  
 
Sound (15/15) Simply amazing.  
 
Animation (15/15) Simply Amazing.  
 
Overall: 82/100 
 
Movie 1 was a very good start to this series, and will be a tough movie to beat. While this movie (and the rest of the series) is a murder mystery, it is more the kind of mystery you want solved for you than a mystery you are actively engaged in trying to solve, at least that's how it was for me. The story of Movie 1 deals mostly with suicide and loneliness, and those seem to be the problem the villain is facing. Overall the movie does a good job in telling the story, but lacks any character details. The dialogue between the characters are great though. (28/35) 
 
Because we are thrown basically in the middle of the story, the characters will seem like a mystery to you in the first movie. You aren't told much about them, perhaps we are told too little about them. Regardless, the characters are somewhat interesting, even if we aren't sure of their purpose yet (and why they have such dangerous jobs). I think the character we are supposed to focus the most on is the villain, as this is her only time to shine in the series. I thought she was a good antagonist, but certainly not the best in this series. (24/35) 
 
If you have read anything about Kara kn Kyoukai, it probably has something to do with its production values. The music in this show is simply amazing. It is composed by Yuki Kajiura, who composed music for way too many shows to list, but some of there recent ones include Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, Sword Art Online, and the .hack series. I haven't heard all of her work, but this is one of, if not the best of her work IMO. I really adore this soundtrack. (15/15) 
 
The animation is just as good as the music. This movie was made by ufotable, who is also responsible for the beautiful Fate/Zero series. So think animation like Fate/Zero, only better. From what I hear this series had a big budget, and from the looks of it they spent their money very well. At first glance it may not look special because of the setting is a Japanese city and the story always happens at night. But when you look past that and actually see the animation for what it is, you will end up in love with it. (15/15) 
 
This is a great start to a great series, a personal favorite of mine. One thing I really like about it is they it can be enjoyed simply because of its production valued alone. The action scenes in this movie are great, and the score that accompanies it is equally amazing. But you can also enjoy this series for its dialogue and story almost as much as you can its production values. (82/100)

    Kara no Kyoukai is an Action, Mystery, Thriller, Supernatural and Romance anime made by one of my favorite production studios, Ufotable. When I think about it, I can't say that I loved it, but it is not like I hate it either. I am neutral about it but it was good. Now let's discuss the details in the review.  
 
PLOT AND STORY LINE                                                                                                     
 
Kara no Kyoukai follows Shiki Ryougi, a girl who, after a terrible car accident, stayed in coma for two years. Being a member of the Ryougi family, Shiki owned a dual personality, a feminine and a masculine side which were created by splitting her soul. After waking up from the coma, Shiki realized that the masculine side was gone but as an after effect she gained the power to perceive death with her 'Mystic Eyes'. The ability to kill any living being with only a knife lures Shiki into a darker world but fortunately for her, she is not alone.  
The thing about Kara no Kyoukai is that it is really complicated. Actually, it is not the story that is complicated but the story-line. The movies actually tell Shiki's story in a retrospective way of telling. Moving from the present to the past, back to the present then into the future...I found it rather confusing and I always had the feeling that I had missed something very important. It made me think that either I am too stupid to understand what's happening or the anime is really bad.  It was neither of those, just the specific way of telling the story. Now I don't want to say that the retrospective story line is bad, but it did took some time to understand everything. In addition to the retrospective-confusion, plot holes also made the story less enjoyable. Things like how the Ryougi family actually split Shiki's soul or how did Touko teach Shiki to use her eyes are important and interesting parts of the story, but there is not a single scene that actually covered that. I can't remember much plot holes right now, but besides little plot holes that appear in almost every anime, Kara no Kyoukai also had some greater ones.  
When it comes to the story alone it is really interesting. Especially the way the story develops trough mysterious cases going on in the city. They always find some connection to Shiki, whether it is a girl who bends things just by looking at them, a mage that collects deaths, a cannibal etc.  I pretty much enjoyed the whole story from the beginning to the end. It was entertaining, catchy, rich in action and amazing fight and of course romance. Now for those who think that the romance is a side story of Kara no Kyoukai, I have to say that they are wrong (in my opinion at least). True, Kara ni Kyoukai is firstly a thriller and supernatural story but the romance between Shiki and Mikiya is the core of it. Everything happens because and around the two of them and to be honest, it is probably the best love story I have ever seen. It starts of as a cute, little high-school love but becomes a dramatic and serious love story in the end. It carries that deep and heavy meaning of love and becomes the only thing to guide Shiki trough the Garden of Sinners. By the way, in the end you'll also understand the depth of the subtitle of Kara no Kyoukai, ""Garden of Sinners"". It is ingenious.  
On the whole, it takes some time and to watch all seven of the Kara no Kyoukai movies to understand it completely, but it is definitely worth it.  
 
 ANIMATION AND STYLE                                                                                                    
 
Even tough I praised Ufotable for their animation in the Fate series, I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed about the animation of Kara no Kyoukai in the beginning . Still I had no reason for that because, when compared to other animations from the period 2007-2009, the animation of Kyoukai no Kanata rocks. Wery fluid movements, amazing backgrounds and despite I am not a fan of dull environment it actually amazingly brought over the darkness and the depth of  the anime's story. The style is also very good, nothing special but also nothing to be criticized about. As always, I especially liked the action and fight scenes of the anime because they were incredible. I really have to get rid of the habit not to watch anime just because of their age, because even older anime may have good animation.  
 
 CHARACTERS                                                                                                                     
 
 
Generally, the characters are not bad. Still, the only characters that you really get to know in the anime are Shiki and Mikiya. There are also Touko and Mikiya's sister Azaka but they are the randomly cool and genius investigator/mage/senpai and Azaka is a typical tsundere character. Mikiya's character does have some depth in his personality but nothing that special that would make him a unique character. Shiki on the other hand is special due to the story. The whole anime is about her complex and unique personality and I must say that I loved it. She is lovable and cheerful in one moment, but in the other she turns into a killer. Just do not confuse her with Yandere characters, she definitely is not. Her character undergoes a great development and that's exactly why I  loved her character the most.  
 
 CONCLUSION                                                                                                                     
 
When it comes to Kara no Kyoukai, I personally didn't like it in the beginning. Mostly because it was all so confusing and I didn't understand what was going on in the first two movies. Despite some plot holes, the idea of the retrospective way of telling was actually pretty good. I even loved it after finishing all seven movies. Kara no Kyoukai is a catchy and entertaining thriller and supernatural story that still turns around a romance, but around a very good one. It could also have been a 12/13-episode-long anime but it is okay either way. Not my favorite, but I do recommend you to watch Kara no Kyoukai: Garden of Sinners.

    *This review is for the entire Garden of Sinners series not just the first movie.  
 
The chronological order of movies is 2, 4, 3, 1, 5-7.  
 
Garden of Sinners follows Shiki and Mikiya, two college students that work for The Hollow Shrine, a paranormal investigation service. What makes Shiki uniquely qualified for this job is her Mystic Eyes which allow her to see, among other things, death.  
 
Story 9/10 
It's hard to talk about the story because it's told so randomly out of order, but I still encourage anyone watching to watch the series in the existing order because, even though I was very confused in the beginning, this is one of those stories where if you keep watching to the very end all your questions get answered eventually.  
 
Each movie centers around Shiki and Mikiya investigating a different case, always involving murder and the supernatural. Part of what makes it such a great mystery, however, is the minor details that you really have to look for. For example, you see a woman stabbing a boy to death, but if you look closely you'll notice there's no blood on the knife; this gets explained later in the movie and I really admire little details like that.  
 
Plus, every movie climaxes with an awesome fight scene between Shiki and the killer that is just shounen-level exciting.  
 
Also, I said you should watch the movies in existing order because sometimes a character will say something like ""I guess Shizune's vision came true"" and I'll be like ""Who's Shizune? What vision?"", but, after I watch the next movie, I say ""Oh, that's Shizune"" and I get this feeling of closure now that things make sense.  
 
However, if I had one complaint it'd be how confusing some of the exposition is, especially whenever Touko tried to explain something supernatural.  
 
Characters 10/10 
I really think Psychological should be one of this anime's genres because, especially with Shiki, you really get to know who these characters are and learn what their motivations are.  
 
Shiki: If there's one word to describe Shiki it's mysterious; she acts so secretive and her appearance with the fact she always wears a kimono, she talks in a masculine voice, and she never shows any emotion all just makes her more mysterious. Furthermore, as you begin to unravel the mystery that is Shiki she becomes even more amazing and terrifying. Shiki is a good person who just likes to kill people; I think Touko called her a ""murderphile"". 
 
Mikiya: Mikiya isn't as complex as Shiki, but I do admire his devotion towards her and how he can overlook her murderous ways to still love her. Plus, Shiki's smart, but Mikiya really does all the actual detective work.  
 
Touko: Touko is basically just around to spout exposition; she helps out sometimes, but mostly you just see her sitting at her desk smoking a cigarette.  
 
Antagonists: Each movie has a different killer so I won't talk about them all, but I will say that it isn't like they're evil because they're the bad guys. The part where you learn the killer's motivation is my favorite part of every movie because it's always so creative and complex.  
 
Overall 9/10 
This is an amazing movie series, one of my favorite anime, and I encourage you to watch all the movies in order to hear the full story.

    Amazing! Excellent! Outstanding! This anime movie is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen. The beautiful animation, the superb soundtrack, the powerful story, everything plays together in an epiphany of sheer brilliance. Nasu Kinoko's story is done justice with this adaptation, leaving in almost every last detail from its original source material. In my ten years of watching anime, I have yet to see an anime that ever deserved 10/10 in every category... until now. Kara no Kyoukai is a very rare find; an anime that does not slip-up once in its 60 minutes of pure genius. 
 
The characters themselves are extremely well designed, with much effort put into matching their look exactly with the original designs. Aozaki Tohko was the only major change in design for the story, most likely to make her to be closer in appearance to her sister, Aozaki Aoko (A key character in another of Nasu's works, Tsukihime). 
 
The music is well suited to every scene, and the majority of the music is simply a different mix of the same theme, giving the film a sense of unity, with only the change in musical instruments and tempo occurring between most scenes. 
 
The overall story is brilliant, however, for those who know nothing of the storyline, it should be noted that, in terms of chronological order, this film is NOT the first in the series. It is, in fact, the fourth in terms of chronological order. Due to this, relationships between characters are already assumed and the film jumps straight into the story, with very little being explained to the audience. For those who are confused, or are just wanting to know more, fan translations of chapters 1-4 do exist, and can be easily found with a little effort. 
 
I recommend this film to any anime fan. Every part of it screams brilliance and will keep you on edge until the final moments

    This is the first film in the Garden of Sinners series and it appears to be a quite confusing introduction. In this dark film, we follow the mysterious suicides of girls without motives jumping from the same building and plummeting to their deaths. We are introduced to Shiki who appears to have supernatural powers in the form of the ability to kill demonic spirits, Kokutou, a friend of Shiki and Touka, who is their colleague and a puppet master, yet it is unclear what her job appears to be. 
 
Shiki is shown as cold with moments where it appears that she’s struggling with her emotions, especially when it comes to Kokutou, the glasses guy that brings her ice-cream. The animation of Shiki’s movements is emphasised in this film, especially simple things like her drinking water or eating ice-cream - her swift, decisive and abrupt movements whilst completing these simple tasks really helps to show her personality.  
 
The soundtrack is breathtaking. It actually expresses so much depth. Shiki’s theme is hopeful yet solemn and has multiple variations ranging from the big dramatic scenes and the action filled battle scenes. There’s just an eerie yet peaceful quality to it. I know those things don’t really seem like they could exist together, yet listening to the theme really feels like a nice balance between an ominous yet calming feeling. The character design is simplistic, yet the backdrops and lighting is superb!! The battle scenes are also enchanting when Shiki goes full on bad-ass mode. 
 
When Kokutou seems to be heading towards becoming the next victim of the ominous force that’s resulting in the suicides, Shiki takes to scouting the building to defeat this force as she has a connection to Kokutou, yet it is unclear the full extent at which their relationship spans. The connection of Kokutou and Shiki with the puppet master is also one that’s quite curious in terms of how they got involved with each other.  
 
Embedded in this story are a lot of dark themes about the meaning of suicide. It explores the burden that suicide places on all of the people’s lives whom the person has touched and it explores the ambiguous nature of whether suicide is a result of a detached indifference from not being able to feel at all, or is due to feeling things so strongly that only a statement as strong as suicide is enough to show the depth of their need to express their emotions. It also explores which is the harder option when life gets too hard with this amazing quote by Touka: 
 
‘There are two ways to escape: escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former ""floating"", and the latter ""flight"". You are the only one that decides which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don't choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don't choose the path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the path we choose. 
 
What this means to me is that we aren’t inherently our sins, our sins are not tightly attached to our actions and we still have an ability to choose the right path whilst keeping the mistakes of our past in our minds. Our actions are not us. It is not our mistakes that take the wheel when determining what we’re going to do next, but the strength of our inherent self to combat and deal with our mistakes. Whether we choose to live or not depends on the ability of our soul to bear the burden of the actions which we may view as moral atrocities.  
 
I have a feeling that there are many layers to this than I can fully realise without watching the other seven movies but I feel that this is the beauty of this series…to slowly unravel the mystery. If you’re looking for something supernatural with epic battle scenes, animation and soundtrack, this is for you.

    Im gonna skip the obvious: youre gonna have a hard time finding better animation and soundtrack and this is the case for every movie in this series. 
 
The series is not perfect. The story sometimes goes nowhere and calling it confusing is an understatement. Its also very true that the pseudo-philosophical conversations drag on too long and often times make no sense once you strip back the big words and look at what's actually being said. 
 
However: ive never seen an anime that gripped me this much with its atmosphere. The confusion is partially intentional because the mystery adds to the atmosphere (even though the unintentional confusion is still definitely there and is a legitimate flaw) and as such i dont advice watching it in chronological order. Watch it in the release order even though you will be completely lost a large portion of the time.  
Accept the confusion and mystery and let yourself be absorbed by the dark and depressing yet still hopeful mood of the show.  
I also found it helps, when another speech is being given that doesnt really make sense, to just pretend like it does make sense and that its profound. This sounds stupid but it works: just act as if something very deep was just said because most of the time the actual content of the speeches doesnt matter and its more the effect they have on the characters that is truly relevant. 
 
The episodes/movies have their ups and downs with episode 6 and 8 being my least favourite, although they are still absolutely worth a watch. 
 
Basically: you can pick this show apart if you really want to but it would be a waste because a small amount of suspension of judgement landed this a place in my top 10 favourite anime of all time

    Movie or TV? 
 
I can easily see this being one or the most frequent question regarding this Anime. The purpose that the creators decided for movie is very likely because they did not want to follow the regular TV episode release date system (one episode per week), and thought that if they split it in movies, they could perfectly split them in Arcs. Personally, I would prefer TV, though, because it would make it easier to review than reviewing an alonestanding movie where it is barely possible to consider certain aspects, such as the character development. On the other hand, it is a good possibility to consider how all the Arcs were done when they are separate. Still, if I had to decide, I would definitely go for TV. It would perfectly fit as a 22 episodes Anime. 
 
For a short movie like this with bare content, it was amazingly done. It is not ranked too high, though, but I can easily see why. It is probably because this Anime is kind of dark, but in another way. It is difficult to define, but it did not feel like there was much life, or maybe unentertaining would hit the meaning. What I am basically talking about, is that it is more or less difficult to concentrate on the conversations, because they did not have an interesting shape. I actually had to watch the first ten minutes twice in order to prevent getting lost and actually understand the plot. 
 
Speaking of the plot, it is definitely interesting. The plot is about various feminine high school students who all of sudden suicided, without having an actual reason for it. They had a splendid life, and there was one conspicuous similarity between all of those deaths - namely that all of them jumped from the top of a high building, but on the same building. A girl named Shiki went to the place because she was curious about it. That building is definitely suspicious, it is abandoned, maybe it is cursed, which is why Shiki went in it, and this is where the Genres start getting more meaning. 
 
Eventually you are asking this question yourself as well, why does a girl have to do this? Why did the police not investigate the building? So far, this is an unclarified question, which I might have missed, though. The story definitely shows potential, but this is all I can say about it, really. It was not shown much enough to judge the story as a whole, but it seems definitely promising so far. It is quite original as well. Considering there are two really high ranked movies, I can easily this getting one of the best stories ever. Knowing that fact, it will be difficult to predict the story, although I already now have no clue what this could become. 
 
For some reason, this movie reminded me a little bit of Fate/Zero. The plot is different in all considerable ways, but both give me a similar feeling. Not only the art is almost completely the same, even the soundtrack sounds slightly identical. Well, most of the tracks do not sound similar, but sometimes the soundtrack manages to create an identical atmosphere between both. It is definitely not a bad thing, though, and I believe I am one of the only persons who does actually think so. 
 
It is enough to see only one or two minutes of this movie to get the feeling of hardly belief that this movie is actually made in 2007. The backgrounds are immensely detailed, sometimes even too immensely for my liking, the characters look amazing and the animation is magnificent as well. The mere background art makes you want to stare at the screen the whole time, and it perfectly conveys the atmosphere a real thriller Anime needs. Like aforementioned, the art is pretty much the same of Fate/Zero, just with a slightly lower quality. It even uses these awesome background effects, such as the mist you might notice. The art is absolutely perfect. 
 
The soundtrack is certainly one of the best soundtracks ever. There is one melody that constantly pops up in this movie and I can not get it out of my mind. It sounds kinda heart-warming, mystical, and beautiful. It is not only that theme, the rest sounds awesome and fitting, too. I have rarely seen something like this before, and especially that it feels so special in a movie that does not even last for an hour, makes it even more special. The characters were voiced decently as well. There is still something regarding the sound I disliked; the sound effects. They sound unrealistic and unfitting sometimes, and sometimes, even sounds were missed. 
 
Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is a little bit difficult to determine a score when there is not even a real end and when there are barely any development remarks in a movie of this length, so I'm forced to rate it from my so-far-impression. Usually, even when there are several Anime seasons, they have an actual end which makes it possible to judge, but this case is different. But so far, I have a good impression of this Anime and this will probably become one of my favorites, because this movie is in comparison to some other KnK movies, ranked fairly low, but is still impressive. I will make sure to watch and review the rest as well.

    In my never-ending search for good anime, I've tried a number of different series. Some knocked the wind out of me in terms of sheer quality. Others have caused me to question why I even decided to watch them in the first place. However, I've never come across a series such as this, one that tells it's story through movie format. While this presentation of a 50-min movie may cause some viewers to shy away, I for one commend Kara no Kyoukai: Overlooking View, as it offers a nice adventure and introduction to the series.  
 
Now, onto the review! 
 
The story of this first episode is centered around a string of suicides, all of which are without a suicide note. However, the dead are not the only ones who are victims to the mysterious occurrence. A woman by the name of Shiki loses a dear friend, Mikiya, to the ominous force behind the suicides and she must do whatever it takes to rescue his soul. The story is contained nicely and has excellent pacing. It is obvious that there is more back story to come, and thus the lack of such information can frustrate some, yet it also entices the others to continue watching. The ending is also satisfying and loops back nicely to the beginning. The action scenes are few, but the moments of tension easily build up to them.  
STORY: 9/10 
 
The art is from Ufotable, the studio behind Fate/Zero. Even though this is an earlier work, it easily keeps up with the studio's more recent ventures. Animation is fluid, character designs are beautiful, yet down to earth, and the  special effects, such as the blood and Shiki's eyes, are colorful and crisp. Heck, even the smoke from Touko's cigarettes is nice to look at. A warning on the action scenes though. When the true fight kicks off, it looks as though the camera is constantly changing fields of perception, changing focus at the drop of a hat, creating an almost pulsating feeling. I think of it as a nice touch to the action, but it can make some viewers nauseous if they're not used to it.  
ART: 10/10  
 
The musical score is eerie, with choir pieces capturing the mood perfectly. The beginning theme and ending are nice and the voices are fantastic, especially the voice of Shiki. Their moods are portrayed effectively and they don't have the exaggerated emotions that plague other anime.  
SOUND: 10/10 
 
Each main character plays a substantial role to the story. No one feels wasted and I actually can't seem to fit anyone into an anime archetype unless I try really hard. Shiki is a somewhat conserved young woman who, while seeming somewhat cold, cares deeply for those she loves. Touko is a beautiful lady who is surrounded in mystery as her near infinite wisdom brings up nice philosophical touches to the anime. Mikiya at first seems like a typical nice guy, but his importance to Shiki drives her forward. The factor that keeps the characters back is that they never truly develop. They are great characters, but we don't know about their past or anything like that. This entices the view to learn more, but also injures the entire package.  
CHARACTERS: 8/10 
 
I loved watching this. It was a nice treat from the great studio of Ufotable. I sadly was not able to enjoy it fully since there is just so much left unsaid about the characters and their back stories. Once I finish this series, though, I will look at this episode again.  
ENJOYMENT: 9/10 
 
Overall, this is a great way to spend 50 minutes. It has great characters, beautiful art and awesome sound. It does, however, suffer from lack of character growth and a story that takes a hit because of that. This will, however, be fixed as the series goes on and we learn more about what makes Shiki and her gang tick.

""Are you floating, or are you flying?"" 
 
	The Overlooking View, the first movie in the Kara no Kyoukai series was highly confusing to me at first. Not knowing who the characters were and as I wasn't attached to them - I really did not even care about the story. Yet the animation and the sound were phenomenal ,it drew me in and made me watched the whole series. Now I get it why people rate this movie 7 or lower, it was meant to be the first film in a series that is presented in a non-chronological order. But now that I have watched the series the second time, I realized that this was a really great film. I rated this film a 6 earlier, but now it was 10. In fact, I believe that this is on par with the seventh and fifth films, which were thought to be the best in the series (and one of the best in anime in general).  
	On the second viewing and subsequent viewings, you could really appreciate the atmosphere that ufotable expertly crafted. This is a world that is dark and gritty - with magic that are there not to inspire but to slash things. This is anime that has gore and violence, and lots of it - yet they are not there merely for fun, they actually mean something to the story. But this is the film that actually showed how Shiki misses Mikiya, and how she longs for him. Mikiya was asleep for most of the story, which was probably why I didn't care much for him at first. But the longing that Shiki feels because he is gone, now that's what really drew me in. Shiki appears tough and strong. She apparently is immune to all the shit that has been happening to the world, now showed how human she is. This would be further developed as the story progressed, but the longing here is evident. Everytime Shiki wokes up in her apartment all alone you could feel it. Touko here is bad-ass as always, yet her presence is subdued. This movie is after all centered mainly on Shiki. 
	The animation is top-notch, the best that animation has to offer. The lighting and the action scenes were truly breathtaking, and even more recent anime can't even compare of the beauty that this anime has. The sound, given that Yuki Kaijura is the composer, is obviously also topnotch. Kajiura's other work (that I know of) on Fate/zero is beautiful, and you expect the same on all his works. Overall, I did enjoy Fukan Fuukei as you could only on subsequent watches. I is worth the rewatch! For me, the film series is hard to actually like - but it is worth the effort to force yourself to watch it. The  depth of the characters and the story is enough to be seen as a classic.

    Before we start two things I would like to mention :  
 
-This review will be short.  (Spoilers free) 
- This review will feature each Kara no Kyoukai movie (excluding Mirai Fukkin only).  
 
 
Few to no anime manages to reach a certain level of complexity that this one does. Being a short series composed by 7 movies (some of them 40 min long) Kara no Kyoukai is an anime about a peron named ""Shiki Ryougi"" and how she deals with the life around her.  
 
And no, it's not a slice of life type of show, you see, Shiki Ryougi is everything except normal, in every aspect you can think off..  
 
 
Story : 9/10.  Kara no Kyoukai has a solid story (for the most part), the thing is, it gets messy quite easily. If you don´t keep your attention throughout the entire movie you will be losing the trail of it. If you decide to follow the series by their date of release (which I totally reccomend) then you will be feeling that sometimes you will be compeletly lost. They try to explain themselves but sometimes you gotta rewind the video so that you can read again what they said and actually think about it, unless if you don´t care about detail and just wanna have a general idea about the all thing. 
 
 
That's a good point and a bad point at the same time. For a series that can be quite bad because some viewers are not into that kind of thing, rewinding a video just to make sure everything is clear. They might just drop it. But if you are one of those guys that actually enjoys to know everything about the show they're watching then I think you will have quite a nice time with this one (at least I did).  
 
Aside from that, the story takes different sides as you progress in the movie, while Shiki remains the protagonist in all of them, the rest of focus changes from movie to movie.  This makes the story less repetitve and still not losing it's ""identity"". I mean the story is still about Shiki, you just get the chance to hear and watch other characters as you move along instead of only 1 or 2 characters like some series do.  
 
Now exploring multiple characters usually means one thing : They will fuck it up.. most of the times they do ! Either because they didn´t develop well some of the characters and so the series or that specific part of the series was crap, or they spend way too many time with secondary characters and forget about the main ones. Kara no Kyoukai gets away by placing Shiki in the center of everything. She literally is the plot device for any other story (maybe movie 6 is the one who doesn´t follow this rule, but that's because that's the only movie where Shiki isn´t our main protagonist).  
 
As for the pace, I consider it quite good. Slow when explaining the plot and the characters, fast when moving foward. This series do not seem to waste their time here. Every single second seems important and entertaining !  
 
The story is structured (if you follow the order of release) in a way that you discover tiny pieces of the story in each movie so that you can get to the very end, movie 7, and understand the all thing. On top of that, they end up with this specific movie, the last one ""Kara no Kyoukai: Shuushou"" which for me was just the cherry on top of the cake. 30 Minutes of awesomeness :D  
 
For last, the story itself. It's hard to find an original theme these days, as most of the action anime out there repeat themselves over and over .. the protagonist is usually someone who lost somebody and is know trying to get revenge or fighting for others or some kind of shit .. or they usually have some problem to deal with.  
 
Kara no Kyoukai doesn´t entirely move away from this standards, but makes them a little bit different. Our main character is not trying to resolve anything .. isn´t trying to help anyone as well .. she is trying to find herself.. as I said at the beginning, this series are about Shiki's life and how she deals with the world around her. Now what problems does she face? That's up to you to discover ;)  
 
I can just say, you will get amazed. Along with the fantasy this anime also speaks about themes such as : death (what is death, what is the void, what is after it etc), suicide (is it wrong to commite suicide, why we want to commite suicide, is there any advantages ..), mind control (how we, humans, can get controlled, how can our minds be fooled so easily), love (of course (: ) and for last, dreams(are they worth being chased, what are the costs, etc ..)  
 
My point is, this series aren´t just about some guys fighting the evil .. it's beyond that.  
 
Art / Animation : 9/10  
 
Kara no Kyoukai has strong points on this one.. The first one being the pallet used. Bright colours that contrast with Shiki's. Everything seemed to be made around her, and you clearly notice that. She was designed so that she always takes your attention when you look at the screen, yet the background is what contrasts more (she is pale, white tones, what makes her stand out are the clothings or the eyes, while the background usually is much more bright). The art is pretty generic for ufotable's work. Still pretty shitty at dwaring faces ..  
 
Another thing they do get right though, were the covers, oh my god those covers .. so awesome :O  
 
About the fight scenes .. well we all know Ufotable for their superb fight scenes .. Kara no Kyoukai is no exception.. they're spectacular. Full fo detail, pretty and sweet animations, Kara no Kyoukai just meets the standards for any fight scene. Still below Fate's level though :D 
 
Sound : 10/10.  
 
Composed by Yuki Kajiura, what else could we expect .. srsly .. you start the movie with Kara no Kyoukai's intro, no talk, no nothing, just a background and the music starts playing .. right from the back I could tell this would be a great series just because of the soundtrack. and I was right (: Pretty much every trakc fills it's needs, if there is action, let's put some kickass music, if you're looking for drama, let the sad musics take place. They've got you covered, as well as the animation, they did a good job with Kara no Kyoukai's themes .. and oh god the endings .. each movie has it's own ending .. and oh my they were amazing .. what a magnificient way of ending a movie like this .. no words to describe those 5 minutes of ..  
 
 
Characters : 9/10. Really short, each one is well defined and developed. Some series don´t pull it off with 2-3 characters but Kara no Kyoukai does it with many more. Unlike other movies, the characters don´t feel as generic, they have their shiny thing that distinguishes from your normal side characters. As for our second main protagonist (I haven´t mentioned him yet xD), Kokutou, Mikiya, I think you can consider your generic good guy. Though at least he is not as dumb as other generic good guys out there cough* Emiya *cough .. he has a little bit of sense and will be the pilar for Shiki's problems during the series.  
 
The relation between this 2 is quite entertaining and intriguing. Even though it's never the main focus in any of the first movies, it's still there .. it's still present. You always have their relation in mind when the fight scene comes even though we only had 10-15 min of development in that movie.  
 
But the star of the show, with no doubt is, Azaka Kokutou, Mikiya's sister.... jokes aisde, Shike made it all worth. This 7 movies would be just another generic action anime without her. She has to be one of the most complex characters I've seen so far, yet she is always looks so simple, so elegant. It's a pleasure just looking at her with her divine design. We can tell how much work they've put into her because everything seems to fit, the sound track, the art, the colors used, everything seems it was made to max out, to extract every single drop of awesomeness out of her. I don´t wanna spoil you a thing, I promised it would be a spoilers free review so I can´t go any longer. Though I can assure you she will be one of the hardest anime characters to understand. And that my friends, is something that I approve. Most of the times you watch a movie or so for the climax, for that fight scene really asweomse cough* every shonen out there * cough which is a shame because the rest of the show will be boring or at least not has good. But thanks to Shiki's personality, Kara no Kyoukai has both.  
 
Enjoyment : 10/10. It is rare for me to give a 10/10. I'm a nitpicky person, at the minimal mistake I blame the anime for days and decide to not give it a 10/10. But this one deserves, come on event he fucking credits scene was delightful to assist. From the very first second to the very last, this series built up their story around Shiki so that in the end .. yes you gessesd it. The end of this show culminates in a fantastic ending in my opinion, honestly I tried to predict the ending and I failed, pretty badly. Intense, deep, sad, happy, a mix of emotions I didn´t know what to feel .. but I do know something.. I felt the ""void"" .. that feeling of ""What I'm gonna do with my life now"" when you end a really good series .. that's one of the feelings I want endings to have , and for me, Kara no Kyoukai's ending nailed at it.  
 
 
Overall: 9/10. Even though the 7th and 5th movie could be considered some what like a 10/10 I still can´t deny that there is that 6th movie (I don´t understand why this one exists in the first place, probably to cash in some money) and that the others movies, even though they were great, they were not 10/10 movies. They relied too much on the 5th and 7th movie (this movies in some way concluded certain parts of the story). By any means the other movies are bad, they're just not as good, and in my opinion, not worthy of a 9/10 rate, close though.  
 
 
So really short, Kara no Kyoukai is not your typical action anime, it mixes elements from psychological anime, drama, romance, fantasy, and combines them into one single anime .. an amazing series in my opinion and if by any chance you've watched Fate series, then this one is a must. In a nutshell, an awesome series (:

    Abstract: kara no kyoukai 1, is a visually griping thrillar master piece.  With complex charecters and a web of supernatural events that permiates thoughout the series episode 1 is a good portrayal of wether you will enjoy the remaining 6 movies. 
 
Story: 8, Shiki must unravel a mystery of female suicides that jump to there death, while at the same time uncover the fate of her childhood friend.  The only thing holding the story back is that it moves rather slowly, and can be hard to follow the first time though.  This is a series were rewatching helps piece the whole picture together. 
 
Art: 10, Kara no Kyoukai is simply one of the most beautiful anime I have seen in a while.  That said, most anime movies have a budget to beef the art up.  Kara no Kyoukai however does not just have a good budget, but they use it in clever and highly artistic ways. 
 
Sound: 9, the music is fantastic and matches the qualtiy and subtley of the art. 
 
Charecters: 8, While the charecters in Kara no Kyoukai have there complexities, there personalites are fairly straight forward.  Aside from background that you dont get until later the charecters are soild and feel apart of the world. 
 
Enjoyment: 10, If you can accept the slow pace of the movie you should find it meaninful and connect with the world and form an initial connection to the main charecters that will only grow as you watch the sequals. 
 
Overall: 10, The overall score comes from the overwhemling impact of the art, sound and the formula that sums the kara no Kyoukai movies.  The first half of the show sets you up for the inveitable action sequance in which Shiki shows her skills, after which is followed by a solid resolution to the aftermath of that movies plot.

    Before I start let me just say that I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about this series. After watching this movie I still know close to nothing about the series. I understand that there is a deep complex plot based on some novels here but I would still expect at least an intro narration or some other form of back story to kinda help newcomers like me get into the plot. Anyway moving on. 
 
Story (7): As I said before the movie offered almost know background information. I could tell that there was a highly complex story going on and what I did get was very good but it just felt like I was supposed to already know what is going on from the get go. I should not have to read a wikipedia page in order to understand the background after having actually seen the movie. There were a few parts were the story seemed to drone on and other parts where the subplot of the movie did not make sense at all but for the most part the story I did understand was pretty good. 
 
Art (10): Let me tell you that this movie has some of the best visual effects I have seen in any Anime. Everything from the expressions on a characters face to the water splashing was amazing (the latter actually made my jaw drop during the fight scene). Some of the character and scenery art was not consistently up to snuff with the level of other character and scenery art but now im being nitpicky. This movie is eye candy. 
 
Sound (9): Although it didnt wow me like the art did, the sound was almost flawless in everything from the characters' voices to simple audio effects. The music in particular was perfect for setting the appropriate mood. 
 
Character (7): Much like the story I kinda felt like I was already supposed to know all the characters which made it difficult to become attached to them. Kudos to Shiki for wearing a kimono and wielding a katana (technically it was a Tanto or Wakizashi) which is something I havnt seen since Sakura Wars. Still when the main character's hand turns into a puppet's hand making me believe that she is some kind of animated doll halfway through the movie...yeah. Ambiguity aside the characters were engaging enough to make me curious to see what happens to them next so good job. 
 
Enjoyment (8): This would have gotten a 7 if it were not for the fight scene. After spending the first part of the movie demanding to know what the heck was going on it was nice to have a spectacular fight scene thrown in to make me forget that I still had no idea how the main character had the ability to kill ghosts but then I didn't care. Even without knowing any back story I enjoyed this movie.

    The first movie in a series of unexpected candy.  First off thank you japan for being crispy enough to twitter my mouth with delights such as this.   
 
This show is irrelevant to my review, a platform to type inanities.  Yes cartwheel.   
 
Whatever this may lack, it makes up for with an abundance of atmosphere.  And bluebirds fluttering in the space that should occupy what zombies crave.   
 
The discontinuity of events as the movies progress is a triumph.  I never understood reviews that use the word triumph, it isn't like a film has autonomy or reached the 9000th level by sheer force of blond hair. 
 
I imbibed an organic substance once and went to an arena, to this day, that place was swaying with the wind.  As previously mentioned, I believe this to be an atmosphere driven series, the characters are not very developed and the story is thin, with dark chocolate undertones seeking to burgeon your belly.  In actual fact, that is the most flavorsome aspect; the mysterious background of the characters and story enter into the foreground to play a central role.   
 
The tension is perfected throughout, yet this isn't a thriller for the most part.  I am no connoisseur of drama, however these films delivered it in such a package that I didn't call in the bomb squad.  The only real disappointment was the epilogue, which I thought was unnecessary and convoluted.  Whereas I thought the explanations, while expounded slowly, were satisfactory.  It did not need a 30 minute ending of philosophical ramblings to make it coherent, it achieved the reverse.

    This is, in no way organised, in fact I literally copy pasted an extract I wrote to convince one of my close friends to watch it. 
 
 
I only watched the first part(50mins) till now(so the review will be as a standalone), first part is not chronological and so I had no idea of who the characters are or what's happening. 10 minutes into the movie, I actually felt the thrill and anxiety it intended us to feel. I haven't had that feeling since watching bird box, not in TPN, not in any other series I watched in between. I usually don't care about soundtracks but the soundtrack here is actually so immersive it's ridiculous, it pulls you in for a ride. I actually started caring about characters I know nothing about because of the great direction. It hits some notes on depression and loneliness. The first few seconds of the movie had one of the best monologue on loneliness I've heard in my life (I've watched evangelion for reference), the aesthetic themes and the take on loneliness/depression/suicide was probably one of the best I've seen in all of time of me watching and the first part isn't even rated that high which led to me having very low hopes entering into the movie, but damn was I surprised. 
 
Also, this is only my 2nd series I've watched by ufotable, they did a great job in fate from what I've heard but here, it's totally different, top notch direction, great va's and well animation, it's ufotable so it's the best animation you'll ever see in your life.

    kara no kyoikai 1:fukan fuukei is a first instalment of its 7 part anime movies.without introduction viewer will face alot of question that make viewers a bit of confuse in the beginning.Animated by ufotable studio for series TYPE-MOON,by watching it viewers will experience some horror scene and some of it scene is kinda annoying for viewers but its still a good show to watch with blood splattered ,body been torn and some suicide...Kara no kyoukai 1:fukan fuukei anime was really dark with supernatural and horror and some action as it based genre,because Kara no kyoukai 1:fukan fuukei was the 1st movie for it 7 anime the story was really confuse its start with ghost story and a suicide and how their going to solved that case... 
The art and the characters design was really good neither that bad also but if the viewer was really comfortable with TYPE-MOON style of the character design maybe there's no problem with the design,the animation was really fluent with interaction in ever character and it was really fit with the design and the action scene was really amazing also the environment and the background design was stunning and beautiful the colour was well made.. 
The sound or BMG was awesome fit for the animation the sound for action scene was really awesome... 
So an overall the anime was confuse but enjoyed to watch also,the pacing of the story,interaction between the character is not that dull but interesting ....but still is still confuse by watching it... For those who want to watch in chronological order: Movie 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7.

    Can you make a 50 minutes episode which won't give you even 1 thing that makes you want to watch the 2nd episode? Well, Kara no Kyoukai certainly can. 
 
This is one of those anime that put you in a middle of an unknown story and makes you sit through 50 minutes of dialogues without knowing what is going on. Some people like this, some people hate, but it can be okay as long as you get ANYTHING else from the anime to make you want to watch. It can be anything, but when: 
 
- You don't get anything about the characters, their past, personality. Literally nothing, it feels like watching some random people talk for 50 minutes about stuff you don't know nothing about, but even worse, about what you don't care.  
 
- Dialogues are vague, are not smart, are not deep (they try to sound deep but they are not for me at the least).  
 
- There is pretty much no action  at all, and when you do get some of it it is badly animated, not exciting 
 
- Blood and gore is not properly matched to the reality, for example a girl committed a suicide by jumping out of the building, but she is massacred and covered in blood as if someone blew her up with a shotgun  
 
- Music is decent, but it feels not properly matched to what is going on (on top of that remember, that you don't know what is going on) 
 
- The episode does not finish with any cliffhanger nor shows any possibility of story development. Sure, I don't expect corny cliffhangers but when I just sat through 50 minutes of ""I don't know whats going on"" and then they finish me with ""Ok, it is done"" then please, I want to know who made this anime and I will never watch your stuff again in my life.  
 
TO SUM UP: If you want to watch this anime, at the least prepare to invest 50 minutes of your time after which you won't know nothing, you won't feel nothing and you won't enjoy nor action nor dialogues. I dropped this after 1 episode and it is not because I only like easy and corny shonen anime, but because I really got nothing out of my 50 minutes so how can anyone expect me to go and invest more?

    The images and art is what makes this a must see. The anime looks beautiful, the story is horribly lacking, given that this is one, in a series of stories I can only hope that the story will develop with time. Though this being the first of the set it certainly didn't intrigue me enough to want to continue. I found myself pausing numerous times because I just got so bored of watching the lack of story develop.  This is one of those animes that fall along with the same lines as Paprika, in that its beautiful to sit back and watch it, but don't try understanding anything that's going on, you're only going to give yourself a headache. I do hope the other stories in this set do better with the story line, but I'm not going to hold my breath and judging this as a stand alone story, it doesn't do well.

    Kara no Pacing, more like. 
 
The major plot points are thrown at the viewer one after the other without  proper lead ins or follow-up. Each scene change is accompanied by a new development in the plot which was jarring to me. The main character has personalities and traits introduced and then thrown away a scene later, or used in ridiculous ways. 
 
My impression on the soundtrack was that the artists were trying to get an eerie piece to trick you into feeling some kind of emotion during this pounded together 10 piece jigsaw puzzle. A cheap imitation of better works like in the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack with traditional vocals and a synth. 
 
This was a real reminder as to why hard work pays off, as it's very obvious this studio didn't put any effort into Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei.

    The Kara no Kyoukai or Garden of Sinners films are difficult to review. The reason for this is one their own the stories can be difficult to appreciate but as a whole they are fantastic and a lot easier to review. 
 
At the centre of it all is Shiki, a loner of a teenage girl with homicidal urges who wears only kimonos. I would love to alk more about Shiki because she is a fascinating character but that is more for Kara no Kyoukai 2. 
 
In Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fuken Fuukei Shiki investigates a series of apparent suicides where teenage girls have been jumping of the same abandoned building, however, Shiki believes there is more to the suicides than meets the eye and something or someone sinister is making the girls jump. 
 
Like I said before Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei struggles to stand up on its own mainly because although the story is good it isn't great. What save it are the characters, beautiful and detailed animation and the haunting music. 
 
Another problem with Kara Kyoukai is that the series is not in chronological order so if Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei does not draw you into Shiki's world you are probably not watch the rest of the series. Which would be a shame because the best is yet to come.

    First time writing a review, so feel free to criticize/disagree with me. 
 
For something that was so hyped up by Nasu lovers, I was kind of disappointed, since it felt like this was something written by Nasu in his edgy/chuuni days. I never understood why people want to force symbolism into anime so badly. I don't watch anime to be confused (feel free to call me stupid for it, but I'm sure I'm not the only one that just likes to watch anime casually to enjoy it). I had to read someone else's analysis to even understand what was going on (it talked about things that were never even mentioned in the movie, and I don't think they're things that get explained in the later movies either). The characters were fine until we meet the edgy/tryhard philosophy character that Nasu probably uses to portray his own edgy thought processes on. One thing I REALLY hate about certain anime is when they try to get smart with psychological/philosophy stuff. I try to analyze these thought processes that they try to portray, but really they're so unique/unrelatable that I can think of them as nothing more than pointless/useless ""plot"" devices. At the same time, some of the symbolism was just some simple/common sense idea that was made complicated and disguised as something profound in a way to make it look edgy/cooler (but symbolism is also what the viewers make of it, so maybe the anime isn't as much as to blame for all the speculated ""symbolism""). And the even more annoying part is when people claim that the symbolism and ideas/thought processes in the anime correlates with real life (it doesn't....). An anime so edgy, it makes its viewers edgy. Oh boy. 
 
As for the things I enjoyed: soundtrack and maybe art. UFOtable has never failed me with their soundtracks, but I didn't really like it when they used the volume of the music to build suspense. The sudden jumps in volume scared me, which was a cowardly way of grabbing my attention for something that isn't exactly part of the horror genre. The art isn't something I can really complain about, since it was made in 2007. UFOtable has a habit of putting most of their art efforts into fighting scenes (to, guess what? make the anime even more edgier). But now I'm just being cynical. 
 
I probably would've rated this anime a bit higher, if I didn't have the expectations I did from the praise from all those Nasu lovers. For something that was 50 minutes long, I didn't get any background at all. I know the 6 other movies are in different orders on the timeline that might/might not explain all the questions I have, but I just hate it when an anime makes a confusing first episode/entry as a way of pulling in the viewers from their curiosity. This is mostly just a preference thing. Like they could've at least explained some things, instead of making it vague/edgy. I know I used the word edgy a lot, and a lot of people are going to say something like: ""What did you expect from an action/mystery anime?"" And you're right, I've seen much worse. But again, this is also because of the expectations I had for it.

    You know nothing Jon Snow.... 
This is how I felt after watching this film.  
 
What the hell was it all about? Who are the people there, what is their relationship? What is the point? The first movie lefts you confused but still it has a really strange atmosphere. 
 
I noticed some amazing and deep thoughts in this film. ""The scenery you see from a high place is magnificent. Even an ordinary landscape looks beautiful. But a vision that's too large creates a boundary between you and the world...."" I spent a long time thinking about lines like this one. 
 
Aside from that, which is the most important thing for me, you know deep thoughts, well aside from that you are gonna love the characters. Well on character at least. Shiki...she's so cool, really reminds me Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, by appearance and even by behavior etc.  
 
The art was beautiful as well, kinda dark and creepy though. However that how it's supposed to be after all. There was also one action scene, kinda epic...hah well everything with music by Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina girls is epic. 
That another awesome thing, the music here. Some of the songs became legends and every Kalafina fan knows them. 
 
So I won't make it too long. If you like dark and serious anime with some stuff to think about, this one is for you. And don't worry if you're confused after finishing this. I have seen the second movie today and everything is much clearer know, I guess after the rest it will be alright.

    So i finally decided to watch the kara no kyoukai movies. They seemed fairly popular and I’ve had good experience from the anime movies I’ve seen so far. Well apart from bleach and naruto movies, they are just bad.  
 
[6]Story:  So the story is about this girl called Shiki and this guy called Mikiya. We also got a character called Touko that’s the boss of the detective firm that the other two works at. These three are our main characters. So, strange suicides begin in the city they live in and Mikiya falls mysteriously ill. Shiki then sees a girl take her life, and realizes there is a connection between the suicides and now tries to stop whatever is causing them. To be honest, the story is fucked up. You don’t get an explanation to anything really and on top of that it’s a pretty boring watch overall. I got loads of things I wanted to know more about, but in the end none of my questions were answered. Perhaps it would have been better had the movie been longer, because 50 minutes is way too little time. There are some good scenes though, and sure, this could server well as an introduction to the series, because there are like 5 (?) movies left for me to watch. The only way I can say that the story was good is if I see it this way, that it was an introduction to the series.  
 
[9]Art: Probably the best thing about this movie. The art was very good and the animation fluently. I especially liked the backgrounds and all they really matched the feel of the movie. The coloring was also good, it was always this “dark” tone in every scene, which I think fit perfectly. Really I was drooling at the backgrounds.. 
 
[7]Sound: The sound was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. The thing I liked the most was the ending theme, which I now have on my Ipod.  Sometimes I would notice the background music, and sometimes I wouldn’t think about it at all. All in all, it was decent. As for the voice acting it was ok, but you’ll notice it isn’t exactly Hirano Aya or Fukuyama Jun doing it if you get what I mean. But yea, The voice actors dont really get any time to show what they can do as the movie is rather short and isnt exactly packed with good ""talking"" scenes.  
 
[6]Characters: The characters were really bad, really really bad. To me the characters are perhaps the most important thing in an anime, and if you have good characters you can get a good story just out of that really. But here we are presented to our three main characters, and throughout the movie we don’t get to know much about them, and because we don’t get to know them, there cant be any character development either. Also there is a lack of side characters, and because of this the world feels a bit empty. Again this may be due to the fact that the movie is only 50 minutes long, and again I’ll be forgiving since this is the first movie in the series. But still!  
 
[6]Enjoyment: The enjoyment score is an important one, because that’s why I watch, I want to be entertained. As I said the movie is lacking in many aspects and its kind of boring, but it left me wanting to watch the other movies, because I wanted to know more about the characters. I really think the characters can be interesting, if the other movies explore them unlike this one. As I said I think that some scenes were good, and I loved the art/animation. All in all it managed to entertain me quiet a bit, mostly because of the eerie feeling it gave off, but it wasn’t enough to get the score very high.i was wavering between a 5 and a 6, but in the end I decided to go with a 6.  All in all I give the movie a 7 with the hope that the other movies will be better.  
 
Thank you for reading.

    This review is based on all the movies of Kara no Kyoukai. 
 
It is possible to contain the urge to kill ? 
 
First moment: Ryougi Shiki is a beautiful young woman that shortly woke from a coma. With her confused memories, she feels a deep emptiness, as if something had died in itself, doing it with it closed itself. Upon awakening, Shiki discovers that she now has a supernatural ability called ' Mystic Eyes of Death perception ' that makes her look the' line of death of all things '. Joining his great fighting ability and this supernatural ability, Shiki works as an investigator of paranormal cases and murders, since your eyes knows exactly where to cut an opponent and immobilize him, which costs a spirit to exorcise it and a magical barrier to disable it. At his side, always supporting her, there is your devoted friend, Mikiya and Touko Kokutou, a sorceress investigating paranormal events and exorcist. 
 
Second Moment: Ryougi Shiki is a different teenager. She has something like two personalities. One, the Ying side ' Shiki ',  is a serious quiet and reserved girl. The other, ' SHIKI ', the Yang side, is talkative, outgoing and ... killer. Yes, this personality is attracted by death, blood, and have a deep desire to kill. However, his lone rigorous training routine is broken by Kokutou Mikiya, a young man who insists on being her friend. 
 
How this teen dual personality becomes this empty, cold and possessing an uncanny ability woman? What happened to Shiki in the meantime? What are these paranormal cases they are investigating? Well, i present to you this work of art called Kara no Kyoukai. 
 
Is fucking hard to talk about this anime, especially without giving (a lot) of spoiler. Sorry guys, but it is impossible for any review to explain everything that is Kara no Kyoukai. So instead try to explain it (and fail) i'll give some tips and precautions before you watch the series. 
 
1 - Kara no Kyoukai is nothing chronological. There are 7 movies ever released, only that each film has a different time. So, the first movie shows Shiki as a adult and the second is when it is still a teenager. So, when watching the first movie, you're thinking ' dude, what the fuck was that? '. This is normal, the plot will make sense over time, but in the beginning you will float away. Some people prefer to watch in chronological order, which will make you stay a bit lost, but the two orders make sense, nothing hinders the end.  
 
For those who want to watch in chronological order: Movie 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7. 
 
2 - Kara no Kyoukai has a difficult story to understand... and does not care to explain. 
Complicated dialogues, paranormal abilities, many details and different tips that connect a movie on the other. And even with all that, KnK does not bother to give you all the answers, leaving your account by connecting the dots. Attention turns to anime characters, to show people with troubled minds, frustrated dreams, desires, fears ... and how good these people deal with their supernatural powers and their consequences. So KnK requires a lot of attention. 
 
3 - Kara no Kyoukai is a heavy anime. If you want a typical or an anime with cute things, let KnK aside. Here you will see rape members of people being twisted as it screws, shredded people and a lot of blood. This is an adult anime, that addresses complex issues and heavy, but well quality drama. 
 
4 - Kara no Kyoukai is synonymous with quality. Kara no Kyoukai is the eldest son of the love triangle ' work of Type -moon Ufotable + studio + band Kalafina '. Anyone who has watched FateZero knows that this trio is quality assurance. Oh, and did you know that Kalafina band was formed because of KnK ? Yes, Yuki Kajiura Vocal formed the band to do the soundtrack of the film 1, and the band responsible for the soundtrack of every film. So expect a visually beautiful anime, with a plot that balances the supernatural and reality and a wonderful soundtrack. 
 
Now, the characters. The focus is on three main characters. Touko, a mature and irresponsible, sexy, loose and great sorceress wife. Kokutou, partner and friend of Shiki, is the example of the 'boring' guy. But he's the only one able to contain all the killer instinct of Shiki. Not to mention his dedication to her. 
 
And finally, Ryougi Shiki. Is rare to produce a character with such a complex subjectivity as in Kara no Kyoukai. Shiki addition to dealing with the duality of his dual personality, is a deadly killer while it's human. We follow her at various times of his life dealing with many dilemmas , dualities and trauma during the storyline. When confronted with different people , she thinks , she feels , she turns. So when you think you got used to it, it cuts in half your expectations . I confess: i love this character. 
Not to mention that even being a skilled assassin with his knife, Shiki will face more powerful people than her. But she's going to win the latest consequences for facing any challenge ahead. 
 
Ah, the end of the last film for me is perfection in the form of anime. 
But I reiterate: Kara no Kyoukai is not an anime for children, but it's an anime for those seeking more than a simple drawing. Take care to see it , otherwise it will be a stab in your mind and in your stomach. Shiki will make you bleed.

    Ufotable's beautiful use of digital lighting effects, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura at her best, and dialogue consisting of philosophical musings come together to create probably my favorite atmosphere of anything I've ever watched. The story is something like a dream, which means it was simple and yet confusing with unexplained supernatural occurrences, but that's perfect for this film. Such was the power of this film that it had me enthralled to watch someone eat a container of ice cream in silence.  
 
To me, this forms a pair of aesthetic polar opposites with My Neighbor Totoro. Whereas I loved Totoro for its natural style depicting energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults. 
 
After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself.

    Based on some of the first published, literary attempts of Kinoko Nasu, later of Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night fame, Kara no Kyoukai already contains many of the traits he would later streamline and perfect for a wider audience, such as the tough female heroine, the sadomasochistic undertones, the complex and rich background always only subtly hinted at, the long and intense fights, the melancholy air and tragic outcomes, and the peculiar borrowing of techniques from literary modernism. What his later works lack is the sort of daring and ruthlessness most commonly seen in young, still unaccomplished writers: In a recent interview he admitted that the novel had partly been meant as a prank. Self-printed in a copy shop and sold at a comics convention, Kara no Kyoukai, despite containing anime illustration and tropes, throws the reader into the middle of the story, only returning much later to explain even the most basic things about the characters. It's also written in a very old-fashioned style that even gives many Japanese native speakers a lot of trouble. Though cutting back on a particularly nonsensical discussion on heights, this movie adaption mostly stays true to his youthful spirit. So why does it work so well? 
 
It's in the heat of summer and for mysterious reasons high school girls are frequently throwing themselves off an old, abandoned skyscraper during night in modern Tokyo. Shiki Ryougi becomes curious, a girl who can see ""death lines"" that allow her to kill anything having them as long as she traces the lines, even with her fingernail, and who wears a leather jacket over an anachronistic kimono. The cause of the suicides, unsurprisingly, is partly paranormal. What makes Kara no Kyoukai different from most other horror/mystery animes though, is the way it is told. The characters speculate in a strange, almost technical, philosophical-sounding manner about the causes of the phenomenons and a lot is left ambiguous and unclear. As said earlier, no mercy is given to the viewer in terms of the more earthly sides of the plot either. The characters have known each other for years and have no reason to discuss their own relationships in depth. The only thing, strangely, the anime doesn't hold back on are the small, little things in life. Like the endless singing of the cicada, the ambiance of an abandoned building, the melancholy of an evening walk, or something as specific and mundane as having Häagen-Dazs ice cream in the middle of the night. Beautifully animated with a cinematography sometimes reminiscent of arthouse films, Kara no Kyoukai side-steps all your anime intuitions and makes you believe in this reality first of all and more than anything else. And when the supernatural finally does take center stage at some point and Yuki Kajiura's amazing, ethereal music comes on, it feels almost like you're experiencing it in your living room. If you're the kind of person who likes to know what they are coming to, having a nicely packaged, classifiable, well-done fill of anime, you're probably in for some discomfort. For others though, Kara no Kyoukai 1 does what all beginnings strive for: It makes you desperately yearn to get to know more about this strange, mysterious yet believable world and its characters. No more, no less.
