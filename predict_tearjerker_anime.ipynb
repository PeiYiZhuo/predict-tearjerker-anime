    "One of the few pieces of media to have ever coaxed tears from me is Kyoto Animation's devastating 2008 anime series *Clannad: After Story*, a show that I enthusiatically recommend. And I do so not in spite of the fact that it crushed my soul but because of it. If anything, I consider an anime's ability to turn on the waterworks to be a marker of quality. Most of my favorite anime are considered tearjerkers, *A Place Further than the Universe*, *Your Name*, and *K-On* come to mind as notable examples. Even if I don't tear up while watching them, a decent attempt made by an anime's creators still gets enormous credit from me. Given my interest in anime, I decided to take on the task of predicting tearjerker anime as a starter project for me to clarify and advance my understanding of machine learning and Scikit-learn.\n",

    "I used Aurélion Géron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* as a reference text during this project. In it, Géron emphasizes the importance of creating a test set prior to any modeling so that it can be used to honestly assess how well your final model generalizes. I initially failed to adhere to this rule and so had to generate a brand new test set by randomly resampling 25% of the data set after already fitting my models on a previously sampled 25%. (Although I generated a new test set, overfitting might still pose an issue since I had been modifying my target vector to improve performance on the previous test set, and some of the data from the previous test set is still present within the new test set.) Indeed, I was so euthusiastic about modeling that I didn't give every step of the machine learning process its due, specifically EDA. After starting over with a new test set, I decided to spend additional time on EDA *before* proceeding to modeling. Having learned these lessons, I know that I'll allot the appropriate amount of time to EDA and be more concious of data leakage in the future."
